TOSSUP: Just before the coda, a piano piece in this genre suddenly drops from the tonic of D-flat major to the A major of its B section. A C-sharp-minor piece in this genre begins with both hands playing quarter-note quadruplets in 3-4 time. Chopins first piece in this genre begins with a high, fortissimo C-sharp half-diminished chord with a B on top and a G on the bottom, which is held for 4 bars before cadencing in the tonic of B minor. Despite being his Opus 4, Johannes Brahmss earliest extant piece is an E-flat-minor work in this genre that rips off Chopins second piece in this genre, which is in (*) B-flat minor.

TOSSUP: Like a related, purely instrumental style, this music usually includes a tambourine-like instrument playing a four-sixteenth note pattern with the second note slightly delayed, which creates an almost three-against-two-like swinging effect. This style was first recorded in the 1917 song Pelo Telofone, and its traditionally accompanied by a battery of percussion including a large surdo. A 1939 song in this style was titled for a watercolor of its home country. (*) Pagode is a subgenre of this style, which is performed by schools during an annual parade. This style partly derives from the musical accompaniment to Candomble dancing. This style is often contrasted with the more uptempo, instrumental style of choro, and it was infused with jazz to create bossa nova.

This composers second piano concerto opens with the soloist playing a quick scale up to a trill thats sustained under a trumpet fanfare. His first piano concerto begins with low Bs pounded out by the timpani and then by the soloist, horns, and trombones, at the bottom of their ranges. In a book on this composers music by Elliott Antokoletz, the opening of his third piano (*) concerto is analyzed as a mixture of E-Mixolydian and E-Dorian modes.

In this piece, a section labeled "alla 'Notte e giorno faticar' di Mozart" is followed by a parody of the  nger exercises of Johann Baptist Cramer. This piece climaxes with a fugue in the foreign key of E- lat major, which transitions into a  nal minuet sometimes compared to the Arietta from the composer's 32nd piano sonata.

Another of these compositions features a third movement in which the trio is replaced by an "alternativo" consisting almost entirely of E-flat major scales. One of these works by this composer contains a D-minor third movement in the form of a two-part canon called the "Witches' Minuet" and gets its nickname from the opening A-D, E-A sequence in its first movement. The first movement of another of these pieces opens with a theme that comprises the notes G-E-F-D-C, a musical acronym for "Gott Erhalte Franz Den Kaiser," a piece by its composer that it also quotes.

A composer from this country divided tones into quarters and up to sixteenths in his microtonal theory dubbed "The Thirteenth Sound." An orchestral piece by a composer from here depicts the ritualistic (*) killing of a snake. While living in this country, Conlon Nancarrow wrote his Studies for Player Piano. A popular waltz from this country is "Over the Waves," and other composers from here wrote Sinfonia India and SensemayA. For 10 points, name this home country of Julian Carrillo, Silvestre Revueltas, and Carlos ChAvez, which was also the birthplace of ensembles such as mariachi bands.

ANSWER: Mexico

TOSSUP: Jim Samson has argued that one of these pieces can only be explained by a two-key scheme of F major and A minor in a chapter on "Alternatives to Monotonality in" their composer. The Klindworth edition of the first of these pieces controversially replaces the E-flat in the last bar of the introduction with a D. That first piece in this group ends with a "Presto con Fuoco" coda, and unusually begins with an arpeggiated Neapolitan chord, in this case an A-flat major chord in first inversion. While the other pieces in this group are all in (*) 6/8 time, that first piece in the group begins in 4/4 and later transitions to 6/4, then back to 4/4. That first member of them is in G minor, while the second piece in this set of four is dedicated to Robert Schumann, who claimed that the fourth one was inspired by the poem "The Three Budrys" by Adam Mickiewicz. For 10 points, name this set of four pieces by Frederic Chopin, which share their name with an old French poetic form.

ANSWER: Frederic Chopin's Ballades [Chopin's name not required after it is read]

TOSSUP: Charles Hamm divided this composer's works into nine chronological groups based on "mensural practice." This composer wrote a chanson which laments that "to love is so bitter that I want to throw myself into the sea." This composer inserted the names of Pope Eugene IV and King Sigismund of Bohemia at the end of his motet "Supremum est mortalibus bonum."  This composer's now-lost requiem was written following his permanent return to Cambrai.  He is the confirmed author of 13 isorhythmic motets considered the highest achievements of the genre. A communion by him is the earliest surviving piece to explicitly use the (*) fauxbourdon technique, although that technique was probably imported from England. A song by this composer, possibly written for the wedding of Dauphin Louis of Savoy, was later used as the cantus firmus for one of his four late mass cycles, marking the first time a composer used a popular song for such a purpose. This composer of Se la face ay pale was considered the leading composer of a school centered at Dijon which also included Gilles Binchois. For 10 points, name this French composer considered by contemporaries as the greatest of the 15th-century Burgundian school.

ANSWER: Guillaume Du Fay [or Du Fayt; apparently it's pronounced "doo-fah-ee"]

TOSSUP: A set of six baroque sonatas for this instrument contains various character pieces interspersed or "medleyed" among larger pieces named L'Henriette and La Chauvet.  Michel Blavet was an early virtuoso on this instrument, which is the only one that does not play at the opening of the Fifth Brandenburg concerto, instead entering after the end of the first phrase. Jacques-Martin Hotteterre wrote one of the earliest treatises on playing this instrument in its revised three-section design. To let it play E-flat, a second (*) key was added to it by Johann-Joachim Quantz. It's not a string instrument, but Georg Philip Telemann composed 12 fantasias for it as well as six Sonatas sans basse for two of them. During the baroque period, it was sometimes known simply as the traverso or traversiere.  It was the primary instrument of the composer who provided JS Bach with the theme for The Musical Offering. For 10 points, name this woodwind instrument played by Frederick the Great, which is held transversely unlike its relative the recorder.

ANSWER: flute

TOSSUP: In one painting, this person stands to the right of a daughter of Philip the Good dressed in black and praying. That work by Jean Hey shows this person "presenting" Madeleine of Burgundy. Pieter van Coninxloo has been offered as a possible candidate for the identity of the 16th century "Master of the Legend of" this figure. This person stands next to a boulder behind a crowd of hermits in a panel of the Ghent Altarpiece, and receives communion from Saint Maximin while covered only in hair in a namesake altarpiece by Lucas Moser. In one painting, this character wears red sleeves and stands to the right of an extravagantly dressed (*) Joseph of Arimathea. The artist of that painting also portrayed this character in the right panel of his Braque Triptych, and in a fragment by that artist, this woman reads a book of hours while sitting against a cabinet next to an alabaster jar of ointment. For 10 points, name this woman at the far right of Rogier van der Weyden's Descent from the Cross, frequently depicted during her thirty years in the desert following the Crucifixion as "penitent."

ANSWER: Mary Magdalene [accept Penitent Magdalene; prompt on "Mary" but not "Virgin Mary"]

TOSSUP: The fact that one piece in this genre was composed on a retreat in Hardanger may be why it quotes extensively from the composer's song "Spillemaend," which tells of the water spirit Hulder. Gerald Abraham argued that that piece influenced a different piece in this genre by Debussy written in the same key whose first movement contains harmonies inspired by modes from Gamelan Gong Kebyar. The second movement of a piece in this genre contains instructions for the (*) viola to play "quasi tromba" and uses a number of double-stops to imitate a folk accordion. Edvard Grieg and Claude Debussy each only completed one surviving piece in this genre, both of which are in G minor. A second movement polka representing the composer's youth is included in a semi-autobiographical piece in this genre, whose fourth movement contains a piercing high E on the first violin representing the composer's deafness. For 10 points, identify this genre which includes Bedrich Smetana's "From My Life."

ANSWER: string quartets

TOSSUP: The ninth member of a set of 12 of these pieces closes with an A major "Scozzese" derived from the Scottish tune "Tweedside," and the composer of that piece returned to Scottish tunes for his opera Rosalinda. That set of these pieces concludes with a canon on the plainchant theme Ut relevit miserum fatum. 12 of these pieces described as Accademiche comprise the Opus 2 of Francesco Maria Veracini. J.G. Lalande's Voyage du francois en Italie recounts how another of these pieces was written down following a (*) dream of the composer.. In another set, each of the 15 pieces of this type requires different tuning, including one in which the middle strings are crossed above and below the fingerboard. An unaccompanied passacaglia caps off that set of these pieces called "Rosary" or "Mystery," by Heinrich Biber. For 10 points, name these pieces which include Giuseppe Tartini's "Devil's Trill," for a small string instrument.

ANSWER: violin sonatas [prompt on "sonatas"; do not accept "sonatas for violin and piano"]

TOSSUP: A piece of this type is the penultimate movement of Thomas Tallis's Dorian Service, occurring just before the Nunc dimittis. They give their name to a series of 95 fugues, each written "on" one of the eight tones, by Johann Pachelbel. A piece of this type in G minor by Vivaldi uses two oboes only in the penultimate movement and is numbered RV610. Another piece of this type originally contained extra insertions like the hymns (*) "Vom himmel hoch" and "Virga Jesse floruit," and was written for the composer's first Christmas as Thomaskantor in Leipzig. Ten years after the premiere of that piece, the composer took out the extra hymns and transposed the piece from E-flat to D. The text of these pieces is often divided into verses such as "Et exultavit" and "Sicut locutus," and is taken from Luke chapter 1 and often called Mary's "Song of Thanksgiving." For 10 points, name these Marian canticles often performed during Vespers or Evensong, whose title comes from the incipit "My soul doth magnify the Lord."

ANSWER: Magnificats [accept Canticle of the Virgin or Canticle of Mary or Song of Mary before Mary's name is read]

TOSSUP: One of this composer's piano concertos begins with the theme "C F-sharp-G. A-flat G-F." in the first violins. He is not Beethoven, but he included a reprise of the fugal "PrAambule" in the "Gavotte et Final" of his neoclassical E-flat major Septet for string quartet, bass, piano, and, trumpet. The second movement of this composer's second piano concerto is in E-flat major and 6/8 time, and begins with a frolicking timpani solo. He used a minuet in B-flat major as the second section of his first cello concerto, although that piece in (*) A minor is written all in one movement. His fourth piano concerto is, like his third symphony, in C minor, with two bipartite movements that use Liszt's techniques to develop and transform a single theme. This composer's G-minor second piano concerto was ridiculed as "beginning with Bach and ending with Offenbach." His fifth and last piano concerto was written during a stay in Luxor and is thus nicknamed "Egyptian." His works for violin and orchestra include a Havanaise and Introduction and Rondo Capriccioso. For 10 points, name this French composer of the "Organ" Symphony.

ANSWER: (Charles)-Camille Saint-SaAns

TOSSUP: Kevin Vortmann starred in a May 2015 staging of this work with the Philadelphia Orchestra that involved the first ever use of the pit below the stage in Verizon Hall at the Kimmel Center. This composition includes a section in which a tenor sings, "Haven't you ever seen an accident before?", between repetitions of the phrase "Isn't that odd?" with a finger snap between "that" and "odd". The opening section of this work includes that same soloist instructing "Make it up as you go along" and "Sing like you like to sing" after recorded 12 tone words are interrupted by a single note on electric guitar. This composition includes the songs (*) "Things Get Broken" and "A Simple Song," both of which are performed by the Celebrant. This piece was written for the opening of the Kennedy Center and features additional lyrics Stephen Schwartz. It calls for an onstage rock band and marching band, and mixes folk and rock tunes with more typical sections like the Agnus Dei and Offertory. For 10 points, name this "Theatre Piece for Singers, Players, and Dancers", an ostensibly liturgical work by Leonard Bernstein.

ANSWER: MASS: A Theatre Piece for Singers, Players, and Dancers

TOSSUP: Much debate exists over whether to play the slurred octave glissandos in this piece's third movement prestissimo coda as separate notes or with an actual glissando. For the second theme, the first movement of this piano piece modulates not to the expected dominant but to E major, which has a chromatic mediant relationship to the tonic. The original second movement of this piece was later published separately under the title (*) Andante favori. Despite its name, the Introduzione movement of this piece is placed second. The first movement begins with repeated eighth-note pianissimo C major block chords in the left hand. Due to its bright opening, the third movement of this piece is sometimes nicknamed "Dawn." For 10 points, name this piano sonata by Beethoven dedicated to a certain Count of Vienna. 

ANSWER: Piano Sonata no. 21 by Ludwig van Beethoven [or Waldstein Sonata or Opus 53; The words "Beethoven" and "piano sonata" are not required after they are read; accept "Dawn" Sonata before that word is read]

TOSSUP: Mozart added a part for this instrument for the Vienna premiere of his Symphony No. 32, which was not present in the original Salzburg version. In the allegretto second movement of Haydn's "Military" symphony, the coda begins when the rest of the orchestra drops out to leave these instruments playing alone.  It plays the first major solo in Copland's An Outdoor Overture above pizzicato string accompaniment, and its lower range was once called the (*)  principale. Anton Weidinger refined and championed a version of this instrument with keys to let it play chromatic passages. Weidinger was the dedicatee of Johann Nepomuk Hummel's concerto for this instrument, which exists in both E and E-flat versions. Haydn's only concerto for this instrument was also written for Weidinger and is in E-flat. For 10 points, name these brass instruments which introduce the main theme of Fanfare for the Common Man. 

ANSWER: trumpet

TOSSUP: The second theme of this piece's first movement is introduced by the two lowest voices playing in thirds and sixths in the distant key of E-flat major. The last four bars of this piece's second movement modulate from E major to F minor and back, reflecting the key changes between that adagio movement's A and B sections. After the exposition of the first movement ends with a G major chord, it modulates to A major at the outset of the development. A noted recording of this piece was produced with Pablo Casals and Paul Tortelier at the 1952 Prades Festival. The scherzo of Brahms's Piano Quintet alludes to this piece's final cadence, which features all instruments in unison playing a D-flat grace note slurred to a C. This work was premiered posthumously in 1850, and its long first movement was likely inspired by Mozart's (*) K. 515 in the same genre and key. Mstislav Rostropovich produced recordings of this piece with both the Melos and Emerson Quartets. For 10 points, name this final chamber work by Franz Schubert that uses an extra cello instead of a second viola.

ANSWER: String Quintet in C major by Franz Peter Schubert [or D. 956; accept Op. Posth. 156 or Cello Quintet in place of "String Quintet"; don't require "Schubert" after he's mentioned; prompt on partial answer]

TOSSUP: Listening to one of these works by this composer was described as "like staring at a cow for 45 minutes" by Aaron Copland. The penultimate one of these pieces contains a third movement Cavatina scored only for strings. The third of these works by this composer contains a "Moderato pesante" third movement and includes a solo part for a natural trumpet in E-flat that was inspired by a (*) bugler who often missed the octave and instead landed on the seventh. In the second of these pieces, a harp plays the notes of the  Westminster chimes. The first of these  pieces opens with a brass fanfare followed by a chorus singing "Behold the sea itself." The seventh of these pieces was based on the score to a film about a Robert Falcon Scott expedition. For 10 points, name these nine works by the British composer of The Lark Ascending, which include one titled for Antarctica.

ANSWER: symphonies by Ralph Vaughan Williams [prompt on partial answer]
