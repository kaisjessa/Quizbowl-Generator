TOSSUP: The action of a Lie group G on a space must have both transitivity and this property for that space to be “homogeneous” with respect to G. A vector field with this property is always the infinitesimal generator of a unique maximal flow. The “distributions” that are the subject of a Frobenius’s theorem are subbundles of the tangent bundle that have this property. Real-valued functions on R-n with both compact support and this property are called “bump functions.” The groups of differential forms on an object with this property form the cochain complexes in (*) De Rham cohomology. Immersions and submersions are usually defined to have this property. The set of critical points for one of these functions from R-n to R-m always has measure zero, by Sard’s theorem. Hassler Whitney proved that there exists this kind of embedding into R-2m for any m-dimensional manifold with this property. For 10 points, give this term for a function whose derivatives are all continuous.

TOSSUP: He’s not Dirichlet [“deer”-ih-“clay”], but a function named for this man satisfies a differential equation whose right-hand-side is a multiple of the modular discriminant, Delta. Setting x equal to a function named for this man, and y equal to its derivative, and setting g-sub-2 and g-sub-3 equal to 60 and 140 times the first two Eisenstein series, respectively, we can use that function to parametrize the curve “y-squared equals: 4-x-cubed, minus g-sub-2 times x, minus g-sub-3.” This man names a class of doubly periodic functions with double poles at each lattice point—a class of (*) elliptic functions written with its own special script “p.” He showed that, if every function in a sequence is bounded by a sequence of positive integers with finite sum, then the sum of all those functions converges absolutely and uniformly. This creator of an “M-test” gave Cauchy’s [KOH-shee’s] epsilon-delta definitions their modern form. For 10 points, name this German who re-proved that every bounded sequence in R-n has a convergent subsequence, years after Bernard Bolzano.

TOSSUP: During his time as this man’s doctoral student, Alexandre Chorin developed the artificial compressibility method. For coercive linear operators on Hilbert spaces, the existence and uniqueness of weak solutions of boundary value problems is governed by a theorem proved by this man and Arthur Milgram. He showed that a difference equation in conservation form is needed when utilizing John von Neumann's idea of shock capturing, and expanded on that insight to develop one numerical integration method with his advisor Kurt Friedrichs, and another with his former doctoral student Burton (*) Wendroff. Robert Richtmyer's name is sometimes attached to this man’s theorem on consistent finite difference methods for well-posed boundary value problems. For 10 points, name this mathematician who showed that those finite difference methods are convergent if and only if they are stable, a result known as his equivalence theorem.

TOSSUP: Many routines for this task are sped up using Peter Wynn’s epsilon algorithm, or by an algorithm that combines values from a triangular table of estimates to cancel out 2 orders of error per row of the table. The QAGS subroutine can perform this task in cases where there is a singularity and is part of the QUADPACK library, which is useful for doing this task more generally. The Clenshaw-Curtis algorithm for this task begins by using a Chebyshev polynomial expansion to approximate a given function. This task may be accomplished in multidimensional settings using importance sampling or (*) MCMC methods. This operation may be performed with function values given at evenly spaced points using Newton-Cotes rules, while algorithms for it that choose points and weights simultaneously are often based on Gaussian quadrature. Romberg’s method is an algorithm for this task that is based on the trapezoid rule. For 10 points, name this operation that approximates the area under a curve.

TOSSUP: A set of conditions for the vanishing cohomology of these objects is given by Hilbert’s Theorem 90. When these objects are generated by a single element, explicit constructions of them are provided by Artin–Schreier Theory and Kummer Theory. When these objects are commutative, they are related to objects generated by a root of unity by the (*) Kronecker–Weber theorem. Representations of these objects attached to certain elliptic curves were shown to be modular in Wiles’s proof of Fermat’s Last Theorem. In characteristic 0, if these objects are finite, the Primitive Element Theorem states that they correspond to “simple” adjunctions of a single element. The algebraic term “solvable” comes from the fact that this object must be solvable for a polynomial to be solvable by radicals. If an extension is normal and separable, then its subfields correspond to the subgroups of—for 10 points—what groups named for a French mathematician?

TOSSUP: He’s not Dirichlet [“deer”-ih-“clay”], but a function named for this man satisfies a differential equation whose right-hand-side is a multiple of the modular discriminant, Delta. Setting x equal to a function named for this man, and y equal to its derivative, and setting g-sub-2 and g-sub-3 equal to 60 and 140 times the first two Eisenstein series, respectively, we can use that function to parametrize the curve “y-squared equals: 4-x-cubed, minus g-sub-2 times x, minus g-sub-3.” This man names a class of doubly periodic functions with double poles at each lattice point—a class of (*) elliptic functions written with its own special script “p.” He showed that, if every function in a sequence is bounded by a sequence of positive integers with finite sum, then the sum of all those functions converges absolutely and uniformly. This creator of an “M-test” gave Cauchy’s [KOH-shee’s] epsilon-delta definitions their modern form. For 10 points, name this German who re-proved that every bounded sequence in R-n has a convergent subsequence, years after Bernard Bolzano.

TOSSUP: A poem about this man states that “God gave him his boyhood one-sixth of his life” as the start of a puzzle whose solution implies that he lived to the age of 84. The Erdős-Anning theorem implies the existence of graphs named after Erdős and this mathematician. A later mathematician translated one of this man’s concepts into Latin to coin the term “adequality” to refer to approximate equalities used to solve calculus problems. (*) Pierre de Fermat wrote his “last theorem” in the margins of this man’s Arithmetica. Hilbert’s tenth problem concerns this mathematician’s namesake equations. For 10 points, name this ancient Greek mathematician who lends his name to equations with integer solutions.

TOSSUP: The number of certain centers defined over these structures is equal to the rank of their associated structures according to Racah’s theorem. Hermann Weyl proved that finite-dimensional representations defined over semi-simple forms of these structures are semisimple by making use of Casimir Operators defined over their universal envelopes. The set of all the classical ones of these structures are themselves subalgebras of the infinite-dimensional Moyal algebra. A set of infinitesimal vectors from an exponential map are used as generators of these structures’ namesake groups. An operation that satisfies the properties of skew-symmetry, bilinearity and the Jacobi identity that is defined over these structures is called a “bracket.” For 10 points, name these vector spaces that are defined over fields, and which are named for a Norwegian mathematician.

TOSSUP: A variant of this result that applies to certain orbit types is the Mostow-Palais Theorem. The elimination of opposite-signed double points by this statement shows that the set of certain equivalence relations between manifolds is C-isomorphic to the cylinder defined by "M sub zero, cross the unit interval”. This result is used to prove a theorem stating that every Riemannian manifold can have the length of their paths preserved while undergoing the namesake operation - that theorem based on this one was proved by John Nash. As a result of this theorem, every compact manifold admits a normal vector bundle. Smale's proof of the h-cobordism theorem relies on this theorem’s “trick”. It relies on the "weak immersion theorem" also proved by this theorem’s namesake. For 10 points, name this theorem stating that every smooth n-manifold can be fixed in R to the "2n plus 1."

TOSSUP: This scientist names a theorem which states for a given region R with a charge density of either rho-1 or rho-2 and a corresponding scalar potential of either V-1 or V-2, the integral over R of rho-1 times V-2 equals the integral of rho-2 times V-1; that’s his "reciprocity theorem." He names a set of quantities which have a pole on the mass shell, leading them to be modified by adding an imaginary part to their denominator to obtain either their "advanced" or "retarded" variants. For the Poisson equation, the quantity "one over the absolute value of r minus r-prime" is an example of the class of functions named for this scientist. That class of functions is exemplified by the fundamental solution to the Schrodinger equation, which is also called the propagator. For 10 points, the impulse response of a linear differential operator is given by the functions named for what mathematician?

TOSSUP: This property and symmetry are preserved in each step of the Davidson-Fletcher-Powell formula. A system will have this property along the solution of a closed curve when the derivative of the Hamiltonian with respect to sensitivity goes to zero by the generalized Clebsch-Legendre condition. A complex-valued function has this property if and only if the function is the Fourier transform of a Borel measure with this property by Bochner’s theorem. A covariance matrix of linearly independent variables has this property, as does a Gram matrix of linearly independent vectors. According to the energy-based definition of this quantity, a square matrix Q has this property if, for all non-zero column vectors v, the product v transpose times Q times v is greater than zero. For 10 points, name this property of a matrix whose eigenvalues are all greater than zero, and which has a unique Cholesky decomposition.

TOSSUP: Kevin Murphy has developed a MATLAB toolbox named for these things. In an algorithm used on these structures developed by Kim and Pearl, messages labelled pi and lambda up and down are passed until convergence is reached. An “equivalent uniform” metric partly named for Dirichlet is used to score these structures, and is often used by the Chow-Liu algorithm to construct them. Each element of these models is quantified by its d-separation. These things are turned into Markov random fields by moralization, which connects all the nodes in their Markov blankets. These models are learned by estimating parameters using Gibbs sampling, then doing belief propagation to maximize the posterior probability. Directed acyclic graphs model, for 10 points, what structures in which each node depends on its parent nodes according to a theorem relating conditional probabilities?

TOSSUP: John Thompson called those engaged in this project “the intellectual confreres of Linnaeus” wondering if “a future Darwin will conceptualize and unify” their work. Though it was announced as complete by Gorenstein in 1983, it wasn’t actually finished until Aschbacher and Smith completed work on the quasi-thins. Between 1965 and 1975, a category believed only to contain five objects named for Mathieu was expanded by twenty one additional objects as part of this project, though some believe that a structure named for Jacques Tits should be considered a 27th member of that category. This project required hundreds of articles to write up a theorem categorizing structures as cyclic of prime order, alternating of degree five or above, Lie (LEE)-type, or sporadic. For 10 points, name this project whose result was the sorting of all of a basic algebraic structure into one of four categories.

TOSSUP: This technique is used on algebraic approximants to build solutions to power flow equations in the HELM method. This process can be performed starting from a given point and proceeding along rays, a configuration known as the Mittag-Leffler star. It cannot be performed on power series which contain gaps between their nonzero terms according to the Hadamard-Ostrowski theorem; it also cannot be performed if all points on the circle of convergence for a function are singular. Doing this process along a curve with overlapping disks is possible via the monodromy theorem. Performing this technique on the regularized Riemann zeta function is done to show that the sum of the natural numbers converges to -1/12. The gamma function can be defined over the entire complex plane by using, for 10 points, what technique that extends the domain of a complex-differentiable function?

TOSSUP: Assigning a topology to these things--with the principal ones corresponding to individual points in the original space--and then using the fact that these have a unique limit in compact Hausdorff spaces, is one way to think about the Stone-Cech compactification. If a principal one of these objects is the basis for a product, then that product is isomorphic to one of the models used. Los’ theorem gives a criterion by which first-order formulas are true in a “product” named for them. Those products can also be used to construct nonstandard models for the theory of naturals. The lemma named for these is equivalent to the Boolean prime ideal theorem. These things are called free if they do not contain any finite sets. These sets of sets are closed under intersection, contain either a set or its complement, and, if they contain a set, contain all its supersets. For 10 points, name these maximal filters on a power set.

TOSSUP: In 1977 Charles Blair demonstrated that for complete metric spaces, this theorem is equivalent to the axiom of dependent choice. This theorem is used to prove that pointwise boundedness of a family of continuous linear operators from a Banach space to a normed space entail uniform boundedness; it is also used to prove that a continuous linear map between two Banach spaces is an open map. A way to prove this theorem is by constructing a nested sequence of closed spheres with radii converging to zero, which contains a single point, contradicting the terms of the construction. This theorem’s namesake gives his name to almost-open sets. A corollary of this theorem is that a complete metric space without isolated points is uncountable. A complete metric space cannot be represented as a countable union of nowhere dense sets according to, for 10 points, what man’s “category” theorem?

TOSSUP: Real normed algebras are also described using this term, which also describes a series of nested normal subgroups of a  nite group. This term is used to describe a partition in which order matters, and transformation monoids are de ned by this operation. Faà di Bruno's formula is used to compute the nth derivative of an expression de ned by this operation. The iterated version of this operation is referred to as the functional   power, and this is the group operation used to combine permutations in the symmetric group. For ten points, identify this binary operation which acts on functions and is denoted by a small circle.

TOSSUP: An ordinal number α is referred to as a this ordinal if there does not exist an ordinal β such that β + 1 = α. A Hopf bifurcation takes a  xed point to a cycle described by this term. Banach names one of these entities which is a linear functional f satisfying ∥f∥ = f(1) = 1 and f ({an+1}) = f ({an}). The direct and inverse types of this operation act on modules. This operation's superior type performs this action on a   sequence of upper bounds, and a set is closed i  if contains all of its points described by this term. A function f is continuous at a point x if f(x) is equal to this operation of f as it approaches x. A sequence is convergent if, for ten points, what operation on its terms has a  nite output value?

TOSSUP: One mathematician from this country names an equation which states that AXAH − X + Q = 0, where Q is a Hermitian matrix. Another mathematician from this country names the fact that there are more primes of form 4k + 3 than 4k + 1; that is his bias. A mathematician born in this non-Germany coun- try developed the   trans nite numbers and the idea of 1-to-1 correspondences. Georg Cantor was born in this country, and while it's not Switzerland, Leonhard Euler spent much of his adult life and died in this country. A mathematician from this country names the length of the shortest computer program that pro- duces some object; that is his complexity. For ten points, identify this country, home to Pafnuty Chebyshev and So a Kovalevskaya.

TOSSUP: Bing's theorem states that if M ful lls certain conditions, and every one of these in M is contained in the interior of a ball in M, then M is isomorphic to a hypersphere. A frame is one of these which is associated with a knot. A sutured manifold is a manifold endowed with a set of these which divide it into positive and negative pieces, and the Schön ies theorem states that the closure of one of the disconnected components of R2 minus one of these is homeomorphic to the unit 2-ball. If these are   simple, then they are named for Jordan. For ten points, identify this kind of curve which has no endpoints and encircles an area.

TOSSUP: A version of Runge's theorem for these objects can be found by setting P = ∞, and the Bombieri inner product acts on these objects. The Christo el- Darboux formula gives an identity relating to a series of these objects. The Lukács theorem provides a way to represent nonnegative instances of these ob- jects, and the Nullstellensatz concerns the ideals of rings of these objects. Weier- strass's theorem on these objects states that they can be used to   approximate any continuous function over a  nite closed interval. The fundamental theorem of algebra is a statement about the roots of, for ten points, what algebraic objects which consist of sums of powers of variables?

TOSSUP: One mathematician with this surname married a granddaughter of Leonhard Euler before drowning in the Neva river. Another mathematician with this surname posed the problem of reciprocal orthogonal trajectories, while another introduced the St. Petersburg paradox, which was resolved by yet another math- ematician with this surname. The di erential equation y′ + P (x)y = Q(x)yn is named for a mathematician with this surname, and another mathematician with this surname discovered the rule that was eventually named for   l'Hôpital. Two mathematicians with this surname solved the brachistochrone problem. For ten points, identify this surname held by a family of Swiss mathematicians.

TOSSUP: One group of three mathematicians from this country is known as the Three Arithmeticians, and Soddy's hexlet was independently discovered in this country in 1822. Another mathematician from this country used a system called  circle principles  to calculate limits like the area of a circle. The oldest surviving mathematical text from this country concerned computation techniques using an   abacus and was titled the Jinko ki. This country's practice of leaving geometric problems on wooden tablets as o erings at temples is known as sangaku. A mathematician from this country developed inter-universal Teichmüller theory while working at Kyoto University. For ten points, identify this country of Shinichi Mochizuki.

TOSSUP: Note to players: the answer is somewhat general. One of these objects is half- lled with water in a painting often attributed to Jacopo de' Barbari which depicts the title  gure drawing a diagram to demonstrate one of Euclid's theorems; that painting is the Portrait of Luca Paioli. One of these objects is depicted with a number of trapezoidal doors through which the heads and legs of several turtles protrude; that work is Gravitation by Escher. A large one of these objects is depicted on the left side of an engraving which also features a magic square; that is Dürer's   Melancholia. For ten points, identify these objects, the Platonic kind of which are depicted in a diagram of the solar system by Johannes Kepler.

TOSSUP: Godsil and Royle showed that the fractional version of this quantity is equal to the fractional clique number, and that it is less than or equal to this quantity. Erdös proved that there exist graphs with arbitrarily large girth and this quantity. Brooks's theorem states that for non-complete graphs that are not odd cycles, this quantity is at most equal to δ, the maximum vertex degree. This quantity is equal to n for a   complete graph with n vertices. This quantity is usually denoted with the letter χ [chi], and for planar graphs this quantity is at most four. For ten points, identify this quantity from graph theory, which gives the minimum number of colors required to color a given graph.

TOSSUP: This technique uses the Löwenheim-Skolem theorem and the Mostowski col- lapsing theorem to ensure that objects in it are countable and transitive. This technique uses its namesake posets, which satisfy a splitting condition and are associated with a class of names. The original version of this technique is now called its rami ed version, which is distinguished from the newer unrami ed version. This technique's  rst major application was in proving the indepen- dence of   Zermelo-Fraenkel set theory from the axiom of choice and from the continuum hypothesis. For ten points, identify this technique of proof used in set theory and developed by Paul Cohen.

TOSSUP: Kyrmse proposed the term  polynema  to describe graphs which have this property and some  xed number of edges. The topologist's sine curve has this property, but is not locally this. A space is said to be hyper-this if no two open sets are   disjoint. A space has the opposite of this property if it can be expressed as the union of two disjoint open sets. The real line has this property, but if any point is removed, it loses this property. For ten points, identify this property, whose path version is possessed by a space if there exists a path between any two points in the space lying entirely within the space.

TOSSUP: Casper Go man's 1969 article referencing this quantity in its title is believed to be the  rst printed mention of this quantity. Tompa proposed a directed graph version of this quantity, and Michael Barr suggested a rational version. Oakland University maintains a comprehensive online database dedicated to this quantity, including a list of   people who possess low values of it. The earliest known person to have a  nite value of this quantity is Pierre-Simon Laplace, for whom it is 14; notably, all Fields Medalists have a  nite value of this quantity that is less than or equal to six. For ten points, identify this quantity representing one's collaboration distance to a certain Hungarian mathematician.

TOSSUP: This man's work in mathematical biology included his paper  The Chemical Basis of Morphogenesis . This man introduced the method of LU decomposition to solve matrix equations, and also developed a system for the encryption of voice-based communications. His PhD dissertation, Systems of Logic Based on Ordinals, introduced the concept of an oracle machine. He was o cially   pardoned by Queen Elizabeth in 2014, and he developed the Banburismus procedure to aid his work in cryptanalysis. His paper  Computing Machinery and Intelligence  introduced his namesake  test . For ten points, identify this English mathematician who led the e ort to break the German Enigma code.

TOSSUP: The Segre this is a set of integers describing the orders of the blocks of a Jordan canonical form, while the elliptic this is the  rst argument in an elliptic integral of the third kind. This term describes a class of functions often described with the Iverson bracket which is de ned to be one on a certain set and zero elsewhere, and this term is occasionally used to refer to the  oor function of a number. Samuelson's formula allows the computation of the   polynomial described by this term, which can be written using trace and determinant as coe cients. For ten points, identify this term which describes an equation for a matrix whose solutions are the eigenvalues of that matrix.

TOSSUP: Friedholm names a generalization of this to operators, while DieudonnÃ© names a generalization to non-commutative spaces. Another generalization of this is called the Berezinian and is used on supermanifolds. Jacobi's formula is used to di erentiate this, and Sylvester's theorem relates two instances of this to each other. If this quantity for some object is equal to 1 or −1, then that object is referred to as unimodular. This alternating form is also a multiplicative map, and the Cayley-Hamilton theorem relates this to a polynomial. Laplace's for- mula for calculating this quantity involves multiplying the input by its adjugate. For ten points, identify this quantity that is zero for non-invertible matrices. 

TOSSUP: A paper by Morris entitled  An Experimental Analysis of the E ectiveness of Features in [these things]  concluded that perception of them was serial and not pre-attentive. A classic paper in the Journal of Marketing by Hu  describes these things' use for representing data. Edward Tufte stated that a graph con- taining these things would  reduce well, maintaining legibility , and argued that the use of these things represented the  limit of graphical... eccentricity . Flury and Riedwyl proposed that these things be made asymmetric, which would al- low features like   eyes and mouths to carry twice as much information. For ten points, identify these means of graphically representing multivariate data, named for an American mathematician and consisting of stylized faces.

TOSSUP: Hurwitz names a theorem which bounds the accuracy of approximations of numbers with this property, and Segre's Theorem generalizes that theorem. The signature sequences of these numbers are fractal sequences. When viewed from the origin with normal perspective along the line y = x, a quadrant of Euclid's Orchard will resemble the graph of a function continuous only at these numbers; that is   Thomae's function. If the roots of a monic polynomial are not integers, then they must have this property. For ten points, identify this property held by square roots of numbers that aren't perfect squares, and more generally by all numbers which can't be written as fractions.

TOSSUP: The Hurewicz theorem and Blakers-Massey theorem are used to calculate this type of group; the latter process is also known as excision for these groups. Topological spaces with di erent kinds of this action's namesake group can never be homeomorphic, but the converse of that statement is false. This kind of action preserves   path-connectedness and the structure of fundamendal groups. Two spaces are isotopic if every intermediate step of one of these actions between them is an embedding. There does not exist one of these between the torus and the sphere, because they are topologically distinct. For ten points, identify this mathematical term for a continuous deformation of a space.

TOSSUP: The  polynomial  one of these things generalizes certain complexity classes to oracle machines. They're not degrees, but one of these things named for Wadge characterizes the complexity of sets of reals. One of these things named for Borel strati es a Borel algebra, and the  arithmetical  one of these things classi es sets based on the complexity of the formulas used to de ne them. These things are said to collapse if they have only  nitely many elements, which are also called    levels . For ten points, identify these objects in set theory which consist of a preorder de ned on a set.

TOSSUP: Korte and Lovasz introduced a variety of matroids named after this concept for which this concept is always optimal for them. Kruskal's algorithm is one of these things for the cycle matroid, and in general, these things, along with independence oracles, can be used to determine a maximum-weight basis for matroids. For every number of cities in the traveling salesman problem, one can always assign distances between them such that this type of process  nds the unique worst possible solution. In the case of the traveling salesman problem, the   nearest neighbor algorithm is one of these things. For ten points, identify this general class of algorithm which always makes the best short-term choice.

TOSSUP: A set S shatters A if this thing for A is equal to the set of intersections of elements of S with A. The existence of one of these for every set is one of the axioms of Zermelo-Fraenkel set theory. Cantor's paradox is that the set of all sets is its own one of these, and therefore must be bigger than itself. The singleton function, which takes a set X to this thing of X, maps every element of X to the singleton set containing it. If a set has cardinality n, then this thing for it has cardinality   2n. For ten points, identify this object associated with a set X which has as elements all of the subsets of X.

TOSSUP: Mordell names a special case of these where one value is an integer. Abelian varieties can be considered generalizations of these objects which cannot be parametrized by rational functions. Weierstrass names a function which de- scribes how to obtain the algebraic expression of one of these if one has the geometric object on which all of its points lie. These objects are de ned as the embeddings of tori on the complex projective plane. A conjecture stating that these objects are   modular if they are rational was central to the proof of Fermat's Last Theorem. For ten points, identify these curves with equation y2 = a3 + ax + b.

TOSSUP: Martin Gardner developed a variant of this game to be played on a smaller board while preserving traditional rules, which he called its  mini  version. A book by Raymond Smullyan entitled The [this] Mysteries of Sherlock Holmes contains a number of retrograde analysis puzzles about this game. A strategy- stealing argument cannot be used for this game because of the existence of   zugzwang [tsoots-vang] situations. The works My System and [this game] Praxis by Aron Nimzowitch are among the seminal works examining this game's middlegame phase, which is less studied than the opening or endgame. For ten points, identify this game played on an 8-by-8 board with pieces like bishops and pawns.

TOSSUP: The Ax-Kochen this theorem relates p-adic numbers to formal power se- ries, and Dye's Theorem guarantees the existence of one of these for probability spaces. Testing whether one of these exists for any two graphs has not been proved to be either P or NP, and Skiena suggested that it is neither; one al- gorithm for  nding one of these for two   graphs is canonical labeling. The logarithm function notably provides one from the additive group of real num- bers to the multiplicative group of positive real numbers, and an automorphism is one from a set to itself. For ten points, identify this term used to describe structure-preserving bijections.

TOSSUP: This man's barrel is an experiment used to demonstrate concepts of hydro- statics. This man wrote a work in which he argued for formalism in de nition and eschewed intuition. This inventor of the syringe argued that the axiomatic method necessitates submission to God. This man collaborated with the Cheva- lier de Méré to solve a problem about   dice games, which led to the estab- lishment of the mathematical theory of probability. This man had an intense religious experience which led him to give up mathematics, and is known for formulating an argument for religion based on expected value. For ten points, identify this French mathematician who names both a wager and a triangle.

TOSSUP: A generalization of this concept is used to di erentiate time-dependent functions of stochastic properties; that generalization is called Itô's lemma and generalizes this concept to the stochastic calculus. The triple product rule is also known as Euler's this. The multidimensional analog of this identity can be used to show that the Jacobian of the   composition of two functions is the product of the Jacobians of the two functions, when evaluated at the appropriate points. For ten points, identify this method of di erentiating the composition of two functions.

TOSSUP: S. George Pemberton authored a paper titled after the biogenic version of this property, which is attained through bioturbation of sediment. A paper by Berryman and Millsten argues that ecosystems do not normally have this prop- erty, but that human intervention could cause them to have it by exacerbating feedback loops. Systems with this property must exhibit topological mixing and dense periodic orbits. The   logistic map has this property, as does a system consisting of a magnetic pendulum moving around three  xed magnets. A sim- ple system with this property is the double-rod pendulum, and a commonly used example is the Lorenz attractor. For ten points, identify this property held by a system susceptible to small changes in initial conditions through the so-called  butter y e ect .

TOSSUP: This function satis es the equation lim inf THIS(n) ln ln n = e−γ . Lehmer n→∞ nnames a problem asking whether there exists an n such that this function of n divides n − 1; no such numbers are known. A theorem named for this function states that for all a relatively prime to n, aTHIS(n) is congruent to   1 mod n. For prime numbers p, this function of p is equal to p−1. For ten points, identify this function which gives the number of integers less than a certain integer which are relatively prime to it and is symbolized by a phi.

TOSSUP: The essential versions of these hold their desired properties everywhere but a set of measure zero. A lattice is a partially ordered set all of whose  nite subsets            have these, and if the lattice is complete, then all of its subsets have these. If a linearly ordered set has the property named for this concept, and it is dense, it is called a linear continuum. A space is said to be Dedekind   complete if every bounded subset of it contains one of these, and the set of rationals whose squares are less than two does not have one of these in the rationals. For ten points, identify this analytic concept which is the least upper bound of a set.

TOSSUP: There are two de nitions of this term for polynomials, the  rst being the smallest k such that the polynomial divides xk + 1, and the second being the same as the degree of the polynomial. A group is a p′-group if p does not divide this quantity for the group. A group involution is an element of a group such that this quantity is equal to   two for that element, and if this quantity for a group is prime there is only one possible group with that value for this quantity, and it must be cyclic. For ten points, identify this term used to refer to the smallest k such that gk = 1 for an element g of a group, and also used to refer to the number of elements of a group.

A collection of subsets of a set X which includes X and is closed under countable union and complement is an   algebra denoted by this letter. If a topological space is equal to the union of countably many subsets, then it is said to be this letter-compact. This letter is used to represent the standard deviation, and the capital version of it is used to denote summation.

TOSSUP: Ostrowski's theorem categorizes the di erent types of this function for the real numbers. The only allowable instance of this function over a  nite  eld is the trivial one, which is equal to zero at zero and is equal to one otherwise. This function must be subadditive, multiplicative, positive-de nite, and nonnegative; it is also idempotent and even over the real numbers. The standard metric on the real line is given by this function of the   di erence between two numbers. This function is not complex di erentiable anywhere, and its derivative at a nonzero point x in the real line is equal to the sign [spell out after saying] of x.

For ten points, identify this number, the largest number of colors required to color a map in the plane.

TOSSUP: If a patch is regular and has this property, then it maps its domain di eo- morphically onto its codomain. Every cofree module has this property, and a module M is said to have this property if it is a direct summand of any module N of which it is a submodule. A functor having this property on maps is called faithful, and if it has this property on objects as well, it is called an   embed- ding. Continuous functions from R to R with this property must be monotone. If there exists a function with this property from X to Y and also from Y to X, then X and Y must have the same cardinality. For ten points, identify this property held by a function f if f(x) and f(y) are always distinct elements of the codomain.

For ten points, identify this English mathematician and physicist who names three laws of motion.

TOSSUP: These entities are not subject to gimbal lock, making them more useful than Euler angles. These form the only non-trivial central simple algebra over the reals, and are one of the two classes of the Brauer group of the reals. These can be constructed by performing the Cayley-Dickinson construction on the   complex numbers. Dividing one of these objects by its norm yields its versor. The Frobenius theorem guarantees that these form the largest  nite-dimensional division ring, and they were the  rst discovered noncommutative division alge- bra. For ten points, identify these four-dimensional analogues to the complex numbers.

TOSSUP: One of these entities is referred to as orthodox if its idempotents form a sub-one of these, and if every element of one of these objects is idempotent, it is referred to as a band. By the Krohn-Rhodes theorem, every  nite one of these entities is a divisor of a wreath product of certain other algebraic objects. A set of functions from a set to itself, which is closed under composition, is an example of the transformation type of these objects.

For ten points, identify this result from number theory stating that for a set of pairwise coprime num- bers ni, and a set of integers ai, then the system of congruences x ≡ ai mod ni [NOTE: ≡ is to be read as  is congruent to ] for all i has a unique solution.

TOSSUP: The bidiakis version of this shape is a graph with 12 vertices, while the Bislit version has eight. When this shape is rotated about one of its space diagonals, the resulting envelope is a hyperboloid of one sheet. Prince Rupert's one of these shapes is the largest one of them which can be passed through a hole in another one of these shapes. This shape has Wytho  symbol 3|24 and is the Wenninger model W3. This shape, which is an equilateral zonohedron, was shown by Turney to have 11 distinct nets. This shape cannot be stellated because all of its faces are mutually   perpendicular.

For ten points, identify this type of quantity that generally is used to refer to the size or length of an object.

TOSSUP: These statements can be used to prove that there is only one group with 15 elements, and the third of these statements leads to an easy proof of Wilson's theorem. The second of these statements claims for any p that all maximal p- subgroups of a group are conjugate to each other. The  rst of these statements strengthens Cauchy's theorem, and claims that for every prime factor p with multiplicity n of the order of a group, there exists a   maximal p-subgroup with order pn. For ten points, identify these three fundamental results from  nite group theory, named after a Norwegian mathematician who also names maximal p-subgroups.

TOSSUP: This game, which is played with a  xed subset X of a topological space Y , is determined if X has the Baire property in Y . The second player has a winning strategy in this game if X is of the  rst category in Y , that is, if X is countable and Y is T1 and has no isolated points. This was the  rst in nite- positional game of perfect information to be studied. Identify this topological game in which two players alternate in choosing progressively nested members of a family of subsets of a topological space in an attempt to have their in nite intersection cover, or not cover, a  xed subset of that space, for   ten points.

TOSSUP: A branch of set theory named after this thing was developed by Howard Han- son; in that  eld, sets which can be transformed into one another by inversion or transposition are said to belong to the same set class. David Lewin developed transformational theory, a way to apply groups to the theory of this thing, in his paper  Generalized [This Thing] Intervals and Transformations . A book by Dave Benson describes this thing as  a Mathematical   O ering , and has chapters entitled  Consonance and dissonance  and  Scales and temperaments: the  vefold way . For ten points, identify this  ne art practiced by people such as Philip Glass and Pyotr Chaikovskiy.

TOSSUP: Every sequence of integers possessing a positive value of the upper Banach version of this quantity must contain arbitrarily long arithmetic progressions by Szemerédi's theorem.

The generating function for these numbers is 1−x3 . Fermat's sandwich theorem states that only one positive integer is sandwiched between one of these numbers and a perfect   cube, and only 31 numbers cannot be expressed as the sum of distinct ones of these. Every positive integer can be expressed as the sum of no more than four of these numbers, and these numbers cannot end in 2, 3, 7, or 8 mod 10. For ten points, identify these products of an integer with itself.

One of these things is in two variables and is named for its six discoverers; that one of these things is the   HOMFLY [read as: hom- ea] one. The  rst-discovered one of these things is symmetric and named for Alexander. Another of these is de ned through a skein relation and takes the value of 1 on the unknot; that one is named for Jones. For ten points, identify these algebraic objects which are used as invariants to describe knots.

TOSSUP: Madhava names a special case of these entities, and Laurent names anextension of these entities which can be used to accommodate discontinuities.         If a function is equal to one of these for all complex numbers it is known as   −1entire. Notably, one of these for the function e x2 is identically zero because all of the function's derivatives are zero at zero.

This shape can be constructed from a rectangle by gluing opposite sides together without twists, and consistent with the Heawood conjecture, it requires seven colors to color every map on it. For ten points, identify this shape which has a hole in it, and is the inspiration for the common saying that topologists can't tell a co ee mug from a donut.

TOSSUP: Feuerbach names one of these shapes passing through the orthocenter of atriangle and centered on the nine-point circle, and Y  names one of these shapeswhose vertices are at the centroid and orthocenter of a triangle. These shapes      √ are called rectangular if their   eccentricity is equal to 2, and one of their axes does not actually contain any points on the shape.

In the modular type of this branch of mathematics, Maschke's theorem does not hold because a certain en- tity is not invertible. If an equivariant map exists between two vector spaces in this  eld of study, they are isomorphic examples of the namesake object of this eld of study, which is a homomorphism from a group or algebra to a set of   matrices. For ten points, identify this  eld of mathematics concerned with ex- pressing the elements of algebraic structures as linear transformations of vector spaces.

TOSSUP: One result with this name is also known as the Fisher-Tippett-Gnedenko theorem, and states that certain limit distributions must belong to one of three families of distributions. This result is used to prove Rolle's theorem, because in that case it requires either that the function be constant, or that at some point it has derivative zero. This result follows from the statement that closed and bounded sets   map to closed and bounded sets. For ten points, identify this elementary result from real analysis which says that any continuous function from a closed and bounded set to the real numbers has both a minimum and maximum.

TOSSUP: Wilson names one of these for a prime p which must be divisible by p for p to be a Wilson prime. Grün's lemma states that the center of one of these of      a perfect group is trivial. Any local ring only has one this ring which is a  eld; that is called the residue  eld. The cokernel of a group homomorphism is this of its image on the target group. A ring described by this term is obtained by   partitioning the ring into equivalence classes based on an ideal of that ring. For a group G and normal subgroup H, the this group of H in G is the group of cosets of H. For ten points, identify this term used to refer to the result of a division operation.

TOSSUP: GÃ¥rding's inequality gives a lower bound for one of these entities acting on Lu and u. Beauzam and DÃ©got's identity relates one of these which acts on P Â·Q and R Â· S to a sum; that one is the Bombieri one. If one of these constructs also de nes a complete metric, the space it acts on is known as a Hilbert space. One example of these acts on two functions f and g and returns the integral of f(x)g(x), and this operation performed on a and a is de ned to be the norm of a. For ten points, identify this class of operations which generalize the dot product. 

TOSSUP: Ira Poll has proposed a method for breaking ties in a heuristic algorithm for  nding these; that algorithm is Warnsdorf's rule. George Koltanowski was famous for giving performances in which he performed one of these things while blindfolded. One of these things is used to set the order of the chapters in the Oulipo novel Life a User's Manual. A Sanskrit poetic work which can be read either normally or by following one of these things is entitled  Arrangement in the steps of a   horse . Unlike the general Hamiltonian path problem, these things can be found in linear time. For ten points, identify these sequences of chess moves in which a certain piece visits every square on the board exactly once.

TOSSUP: This statement was  rst proved as a lemma on the way to proving the intermediate value theorem. This theorem can be easily derived from Cantor's intersection theorem, which deals with nested intervals. One way of stating this theorem is that every in nite bounded set in Rn has an   accumulation point. A corollary of this theorem is the Heine-Borel theorem, that is, that any subset of Rn is compact if and only if it is closed and bounded. For ten points, identifythis doubly-eponymous theorem which states that every bounded sequence has a convergent subsequence.

TOSSUP: The Lucas correspondence relates the Hanoi graph to a graph derived from this object. One early reference to this object called it the Staircase of Mount Meru, and in some countries, this object is alternately named for Yang Hui or   Khayyam. If part of this object is represented as a matrix, the determinant of that matrix will be 1. The diagonals of this object contain the  gurate numbers of simplices with progressively higher dimension; this notably includes the tri- angular numbers. This object's entries correspond to coe cients of binomials. For ten points, identify this object in which every number is the sum of the two numbers above it.

TOSSUP: A book by Kobayashi and Nomizu on di erential geometry was described by J. Eells as  essentially a [one of these works] . One of these works contains descriptions of alligation, the rule of false position, and the rule of three; that work was written by Edward Cocker. The equals sign was introduced in another of these works by Robert Recorde entitled Arithmetick: or, the Ground of Arts. Robin Hartshorne's   Algebraic Geometry is one of these works which dealt with scheme theory in a way accessible to graduate students. Sheldon Axler's Linear Algebra Done Right is an example of, for ten points, what type of work which also includes the Prentice Hall Mathematics series?

TOSSUP: A book by Guerino Mazzola connects music to this  eld of mathemat- ics. Many practitioners of this  eld refer to breaking equivalence-invariance as evil . A subset of this  eld of mathematics concerns a generalization of point- set topologies which have elementary and Grothendieck types. A fundamental result in this branch of mathematics generalizes Cayley's theorem and makes statements about   functors which are morphisms onto a  xed object; that result is the Yoneda lemma. Topos theory is a subset of, for ten points, what this  eld of mathematics which deals with collections of objects and arrows, the so-called  abstract nonsense ?

TOSSUP: An article in a September 1992 issue of Computer Shopper detailed how this programming language took 17 hours to complete a benchmark that C per- formed in half a second. This programming language's manual contains a tonsil,because  all other reference manuals have Appendices, [so] it was decided that [this language's] manual should contain some other type of removable organ . This language uses a question mark for XOR to  correctly express the average person's reaction on  rst encountering exclusive-or . Programs in this language will be rejected for improper quantities of   politeness unless an appropriate fraction of lines begin with the word PLEASE. For ten points, identify this eso- teric programming language, an abbreviation of  The Compiler Language with No Pronounceable Acronym .

TOSSUP: This work opens by stating that  it is a melancholy experience for a profes-sional mathematician to  nd himself writing about mathematics . This work,which declares that  there is no permanent place in the world for ugly math-ematics , also says that  the best mathematics is serious as well as beautiful .This work uses the Euclid's proof of the in nitude of the primes and Pythago-       √ 2 to provide examples of good mathematics. This work, which argues that pure, or    real , math is superior to applied, or  trivial  math, recounts the author's interaction with Srinivasa Ramanujan in which he declared that the number 1729 was boring. For ten points, identifythis essay by G. H. Hardy which examines the aesthetics of mathematics.

TOSSUP: A surface is called a this developable of a curve y if it can be parametrized as x(u, v) = y(u)+vA(u), where A is a vector that also has this property. A squareintegrable function φ has this property if it ful lls the condition φ(t) dt = 1. Given a matrix equation Ax = b, the corresponding equation with this property is   AT Ax = AT b, and in this equation, AT A is a matrix with this property. ForasubgroupH ofagroupG,ifxHx−1 =H forallxinH,thenH hasthis property. A number has this property if every digit and string of digits appears with expected frequency in its decimal expansion. For ten points, identify this property, which is possessed by a vector perpendicular to a plane.

TOSSUP: A local surface is a mapping from an open subset of the Cartesian plane to Rn that has this property, and all topological manifolds on three dimensions or fewer have this property. Functions that have this property only on a set of Lebesgue measure zero include one named for Blancmange. A function is complex   analytic if it has this property at every point in the complex plane, and any function with this property is also continuous. For ten points, identifythis property held by a function f at a point x if the limit as h goes to zero of

TOSSUP: A form of this property named for Melnikov generalizes it to measures, and the scalar form of this quantity is equal to the product of the metric tensor and the Ricci tensor. One form of this quantity is de ned as the determinant of theshape operator and is named for Gauss. The Frenet formulas express a curve in terms of torsion, starting point, and this quantity, which is equal to the   magnitude of the rate of change of the tangent vector. This quantity is de ned as the reciprocal of its namesake radius. For 10 points, identify this quantity usually denoted kappa which describes how much a surface differs from being  flat.

TOSSUP: One of these things comprises the coat of arms of the Statistical Society of Canada. A stained-glass window in Caius College, Cambridge depicts one of these and honors Ronald Fisher, whose work Design of Experiments used   these things for experimental design. McKay and Rogoyski, in a 1995 paper, counted the number of these things with order 10 and higher. These things can be divided into isotopy classes and expressed in orthogonal array representation. Solutions to   Kenken and Sudoku puzzles are examples of these things. For ten points, identify these n Ã— n arrays which contain every integer from 1 to n exactly once in each row and column.

TOSSUP: Marden's theorem says that the foci of the Steiner inellipse can be foundby solving an equation over this set. Functions from this set to itself can beholomorphic if they ful ll certain conditions. Argand diagrams are used tovisually represent elements of this set. On this set, any in nitely di erentiablefunction is   analytic. The elements of this algebraically closed set can beexpressed in phasor form. This set is not an ordered  eld because it fails tosatisfy the requirement that every element's square be positive. For ten points, √ −1.

TOSSUP: A mathematician who co-names a theorem about convergent sequences with Weierstrass also held this non-academic occupation. The developer of the mean speed theorem and a member of the Oxford Calculators, Thomas Bradwardine, held this occupation and was elevated to a very high position within it shortly before his death. The mathematician who discovered the determinant form for the higher-order chain rule, and after whom it is named, held this occupation and was   beati ed as a result of his work in this occupation. Marin Mersenne notably held, for ten points, what general occupation of formal involvement with religion?

TOSSUP: The Nielsen-Schreier theorem states that any subgroup of one of these groups is another one of these groups, and the instance of this group on two elements is SQ universal. Any group is the homomorphic image of one of these, and these groups are not abelian unless their generating set has only one element. The fundamental group of the  gure eight is an example of one of these groups, and the group of integers under addition is isomorphic to this with one generator. These groups are made up of   words, and the operation on those words is concatenation. For ten points, identify this class of groups where there is no relationship between group generators other than between an element and its inverse.

TOSSUP: The Graham scan and SMAWK algorithms use this data structure to or- ganize information, and the Burroughs B5000 was designed based around this data structure. Chef and FALSE are examples of programming languages based around this thing, which is also central to the Forth family of languages. Ma- chines named for this structure are contrasted with   register machines. The peek operation allows a program to see the top element of this structure without removing it. Possessing push and pop operations, for ten points, identify this data structure with last-in- rst-out properties.

TOSSUP: Roth's theorem states that if alpha is in this set, then the inequality α − q <1 has  infinitely many solutions. The Hermite-Lindemann theorem states that 2q+εno sum of terms of the form Aeb, where A and b are members of this set, can equal zero. Conway's constant is a member of this set with degree 71. The primitive element of an extension field is always an element of this set. It's not the rationals or the irrationals, but this set is often notated with a double-struck Q with a line over it, to symbolize its role as the closure of the rationals. For ten points, identify this set of solutions to polynomials with integer coeffcients.

TOSSUP: Sarkozy's theorem guarantees that for sufficiently large n, a certain function of n does not have this property. An integer n divides an −a i  p−1 divides n−1 for prime divisors p of n and n has this property, by Korselt's criterion. A word has this property if none of its subwords consist of two duplicated subwords. The Möbius function of all numbers without this property is zero. A conjecture of Erdos states that for all n > 4, 2n choose n has this property. An expression is in simplest radical form if the number under the square root has this property. For ten points, identify this property held by numbers with no duplicated prime factors, that is, no factors which are perfect squares.

TOSSUP: This novel's protagonist describes Conway's soldiers as a good problem to do in your head because  you can make it as complicated as you need to  ll your brain by making the board as big as you want and the moves as complicated as you want . A story involving a mathematician, an economist, and a logician describing a cow, and the mathematician's precise use of the phrase  at least one, is one of the three jokes known to the protagonist of this novel, who recites the cubic numbers to calm himself down and prevent himself from harming others. The chapters of this novel are numbered by successive   prime numbers. Christopher John Francis Boone is the protagonist and narrator of, for ten points, what novel by Mark Haddon?

TOSSUP: This term is used to refer to numbers whose representation on a digital clock, as well as that representation's re ection in both directions and rotation by 180 degrees, is prime. The word  in nite  and this term describe the symmetry group of an apeirogon with two alternating edge lengths. It's not  symmetric , but the smallest   non-Abelian group is the one of order six described by this term, and groups described by this term are expressible as the automorphism group of graphs consisting of only a cycle. Describing the symmetry groups of regular polygons, for ten points, identify this term also used to describe the angle between two planes.

TOSSUP: The second edition of a work of this name added an appendix describing the She er stroke. A translation of one work of this name was performed by Andrew Motte and was modernised by Florian Cajori. The rst proposition in one work with this name de nes the sign which represents implicatures. The third section of one work of this name includes a description of the variation of the Moon's orbit. The Information Processing Language was rst utilized to computationally demonstrate the theorems in one work of this name. De motu corporum titles the rst section of a work with, for ten points, what name shared by Russell and Whitehead's axiomatic construction of set theory? 

TOSSUP: Dixon names a test for identifying these things which he says should not be used more than once. These things, which come in point, collective, and contextual varieties, can be detected by Grubb's test. Chauvenet names a cri- terion for determining whether these things should be taken into account, and an earlier criterion for that is named for   Peirce. Two methods for dealing with these things are trimming and Winsorising. The median is preferred to the mean for determining central tendencies because it is less a ected by these. For ten points, identify these data points which are far away from the rest of the data in a data set.

TOSSUP: The algebra generated by these objects is isomorphic in two dimensions to the complex numbers and in three dimensions to the quaternions; in general it is the even subalgebra of the geometric algebra. These objects are isomorphic to skew-symmetric matrices, and are all simple in fewer than four dimensions. These objects' product is de ned as the sum of their scalar interior product, their commutator product, and their order-4 exterior product. These objects have magnitute, attitude, and orientation and are generated by the exterior product of two   vectors. For ten points, identify these extensions of vectors that can be interpreted as oriented plane segments.

TOSSUP: The Whitney sum is also known as the this bundle. When performing this operation, the output must have a  nite number of nonzero elements. This operation comes equipped with a projection and coprojection homomorphism. This operation is a biproduct when it is performed over a  nite number of modules, and it is always a coproduct in the appropriate category for the objects on which it asks. For a  nite number of sets, this operation is equal to the   Cartesian product of those sets, and for an in nite number of Abelian groups, this operation on the groups is a proper subset of their direct product. For ten points, identify this algebraic operation denoted by an encircled plus sign.

TOSSUP: A subalgebra of a Lie algebra is called a Cartan subalgebra if it is equal to its normalizer and has this property, and the ring of coquaternions contains       a cone of elements with this property. A Lie algebra is described using this term if its lower central series eventually vanishes, and Lie algebras with this term are di eomorphic to Euclidean space. This term is used to describe groups whose upper central series terminates with the entire group. This term describes matrices with characteristic polynomial   xn, that is, those whose eigenvalues are all equal to zero. For ten points, identify this property held by an element of a group if some power of it is equal to zero.

TOSSUP: The colon one of these acts on dyads, and the Pippenger one of these isa formula for e. Hadamard names one of these which represents the Riemannzeta function in terms of its nontrivial zeros, and one of these entities namedfor Jordan is de ned as 1 (xy + yx). The cup one of these, which acts on 2cohomology classes, can be represented by the   wedge one of these if it is acting on closed forms. The Kronecker one of these is also known as the matrix direct one, and the scalar triple one of these can be used to compute the volume of a parallelepiped. For ten points, identify this general term used to describe a number of binary operations, which include Cartesian, dot, and cross kinds.

TOSSUP: Allen Yang developed a means of using this technique to recognize obscured and corrupted faces. Fornasier and Rauhut describe, in a paper named after this technique, how algorithms such as l1-minimization could be used for it. This technique has enabled the development of single-pixel cameras that take a series of measurements and use this technique to analyze them. A paper by Mark Davenport et al entitled  Introduction to [this]  describes how this technique could surpass bounds set by the   Nyquist-Shannon sampling theorem. For ten points, identify this technique in signal processing which allows for sparse signals to be recovered from far fewer samples than would normally be possible.

TOSSUP: The Sol geometry is the geometry of the semidirect product of one of these structures and R2. The Baker-Campbell-Hausdor  theorem connects these objects to algebras described by the same term, and Heisenberg and Lorenz name examples of these. A homomorphism between two complex instances of these objects must be a holomorphic map, and the regular Fréchet kind of these are   di eomorphism groups of compact manifolds. This groups are de ned by the requirement that the mapping (x,y) → x−1y is smooth from the product manifold into the group. For ten points, identify this class of groups which are also di erentiable manifolds.

TOSSUP: Only sets with this property can be subselfsimilar, and a subset of the reals is said to be an Fσ set if it is the countable union of sets with this property. A compact manifold has this property if it has no boundary, and if a set is bounded and has this property, then its Minkowski measure is the same as its Lebesgue measure. The singular   support of a function is a set with this property where the function is not smooth. A curve that has this property and is simple is called a Jordan curve. The union of a set and its accumulation points always has this property, just like any shape that contains its own boundary. For ten points, identify this property which is held by sets whose complements are open.

TOSSUP: Smoluchowski names an example of the stochastic type of these, another example of which are named for Langevin. Picard and Lindelöf name a theorem giving conditions under which these things are solvable. The shallow water and di usion ones are examples of these used in physics, and these things are called   homogenous if any linear combination of some of their solutions is another solution. Maxwell names a set of these which feature prominently in electrodynamics. These entities come in ordinary, linear, and partial types, among others. For ten points, identify this kind of equation which relates a function to one or more of its derivatives.

TOSSUP: Tomás Oliveira de Silva has enumerated the free types of these things up to order 28, and Iwan Jensen has enumerated their  xed type up to order 56. The  xed type of these things are also known as animals. One of these things which is self-avoiding and convex, as well as containing two adjacent corners of its bounding rectangle, is known as a  stack  one of these things. Two of these things are compatible if there exists a plane  gure which can be tiled by both of them. These things comprise the pieces in the board game   Blokus, and they are also the primary objects controlled by the player in Tetris. For ten points, identify these things consisting of several connected squares.

TOSSUP: The this mapping theorem states that a nonconstant analytic function and a continuous surjective linear mapping between Banach spaces both have this property. Conway and Croft showed that the plane cannot be covered with dis- joint congruent circular arcs or line segments with this property. A perforation is a surface that has had a disk with this property removed from it. A function is continuous if its   inverse takes sets with this property to other sets with this property. A set is compact if every cover of this type permits a  nite subcover. For ten points, identify this property held by a set A if every element of the set has a neighborhood that is a subset of A, and held by intervals in R that do not contain their endpoints.

TOSSUP: A mathematician from this country names a special case of the principle of least action stating that physical systems follow the path with the shortest length. A mathematician from this country names lattices generated by discrete translation operators. Another mathematician from this country introduced the adele ring. The equation ax2 + by2 + cz2 = 0 is named for a mathematician from this country, and a di erent mathematician from this country names the standard   measure used for Euclidean space. A mathematician from this country names series used to represent functions as the sums of sine waves. For ten points, identify this country, home to Bravais, Fourier, and Lagrange.

TOSSUP: Tarski names a theorem stating that these objects form a complete lattice under certain conditions. Unstable and stable stars are two special types of these objects, which also have elliptical and hyperbolic types. Kakutani names a theorem about these which guarantees that a collection of maps with certain properties must share one in common, while   Schauder names a theorem guar- anteeing that some of these exist for a function from a closed convex subset of Banach space to a countably compact subset of that subset. One of these things must exist for any map from a disk to itself. For ten points, identify this term for a point x such that f(x) = x.

TOSSUP: According to Donald Knuth, the  rst study of these objects was performed by Bha skara cha rya, and alternate names for them included  bunch  and  suite . Replacing the falling factorial with a rising factorial in the expression for bino- mial coe cients gives the number of these of a given size with a certain number of elements. The free commutative monoid on a set can be interpreted as the monoid of these things with elements drawn from that set. These things are formally de ned using a set and a function from that set to the   positive integers. For ten points, identify these objects which generalize sets to allow repeated instances of elements.

TOSSUP: Description acceptable. Adelman and Huang developed an errorless version of the elliptic curve one of these. The AKS one of these is the  rst of them to be polynomial time, but it is practically much slower than the Baillie-PSW one for small inputs. The Miller-Rabin one of these relies on the generalized Riemann hypothesis for its correctness. A simple one of these is named for Fermat and uses his   Little Theorem, however, for Carmichael numbers it fails to be more e cient than a search for factors. For ten points, identify this class of algorithms to determine if numbers have a certain property, the simplest of which is the Sieve of Eratosthenes.

TOSSUP: Tarski constructed an elegant second-order axiomatization of this structure. Adding two improper elements to this set gives its a nely extended version, while adding one gives its projectively extended version, which can be repre- sented by a cross-section of the Riemannian sphere. This set is the unique   complete Archimedian  eld, as well as the unique Dedekind-complete ordered  eld. This set's elements can be expressed as the limits of sequences of ratio- nal numbers. For ten points, identify this set of numbers represented with a double-struck R.

TOSSUP: A 2004 paper by Cong, Wei, and Zhang describes a thermal-driven method of doing this, and a paper in the same year by Adya and Markov describes the use of Paquet-1 to peform the  xed-outline type of this process. A 1993 paper bySarrafzadeh presents a method for converting an arbitrary result of this process into a sliceable one. Constraints on this process include the fact that IP blocks have a prede ned area and that bonding pads are usually located on the edges of   chips. For ten points, identify this process in integrated circuit desi

TOSSUP: The Cesàro one of these objects is also known as the  torn square  one, and the  box  one of these objects is also known as the anticross-stitch curve. Barnsley's Fern and the Minkowski sausage are examples of these objects, another of which, the Gosper   island, can tile the plane. These objects are associated with a quantity called their  dimension , one kind of which is named for Hausdor  and is usually non-integral. Menger and Koch name two notable examples of, for ten points, which objects which exhibit self-similarity and include the Mandelbrot set and Sierpi"ski's Triangle?

TOSSUP: The Gumbel one of these is the  rst of three types of these things named for Fisher and Tippett. The Erlang one of these simpli es to the exponential one when h = 1. One of these things, Student's t-[this thing], was published under a pseudonym by William Gosset. The Bernoulli one of these has two possible outcomes, while the geometric one has a   probability density function of pqn. The binomial one of these gives the probability of outcomes from a set of several Bernoulli trials. For ten points, identify this term for functions which describe the probability that certain random data will fall in certain ranges, exempli ed by their  normal  type.

TOSSUP: A graph is said to be s-arc-this if an s-route of it exists and there always exists a graph automorphism of it sending each s-route onto every other s-route of it. Two points on a surface have this property if they are opposite each other but not the furthest distance possible. A function is topologically this if for any two intervals A and B, there exists some positive integer k such that iterating f on A k times yields a set disjoint with B. John von Neumann de ned ordinal numbers as sets that were   hereditarily this. A group action has this property if it has only a single group orbit. A relation is referred to as a preorder if it has re exivity and, for ten points, what property which states that if x ∼ y and y ∼ z, then x ∼ z?

TOSSUP: A convex one of these for a polytope is de ned as the set of vertices of its convex hull, and a cone one of these consists of one point on each edge of a polygonal cone. One of these named for Gröbner is an equivalence system for a set of polynomials. A completely unrelated use of this term is to mean 0.01 percentage points. The existence of one of these named for   Hamel is justi ed by the axiom of choice, and allows for the expression of any real number in terms of a certain subset of the real numbers. Despite not actually being one of these, a complete set in a Hilbert space is referred to as a Hilbert one of these. For ten points, identify this term for a set of linearly independent vectors which span a vector space.

TOSSUP: One commentary on this work stated that it  [brought] to irrefragable demon- stration the things which were only somewhat loosely proved by [its author's] predecessors . A fragment of this work was recorded on Oxyrhynchus papyrus 29, and this work was translated from Arabic to Latin by Adelard of Bath. Carl Boyer estimated that the only work with more editions than this one was the Bible. Abraham   Lincoln kept a copy of this work in his saddlebag, and Edna St. Vincent Millay wrote that this work's author  alone has looked on Beauty bare . For ten points, identify this seminal geometry treatise, consisting of thirteen books and written by Euclid.

TOSSUP: Propositions 30-32 of Book 7, as well as Proposition 14 of Book 9, of Euclid's Elements constitute a statement of this result. Rings in which this statement holds for ideals are called Dedekind domains. Eisenstein generalized this result to his namesake integers, and Gauss generalized this theorem to the ring of complex integers. This result provides for the uniqueness of   canonical representations. Rings where this result is true include Euclidean and principal ideal domains and are generally called unique factorization domains. For ten points, identify this result from number theory which guarantees the existence of a unique prime factorization for natural numbers.

TOSSUP: Kiyosi Itô included an axiom named for this entity in his treatment of ZFC set theory. A set function mu-star is said to be an outer measure if it is countably monotone and mu-star of this object takes on a certain value, and for any presheaf F on a topological space, F of this object must take on that same value. The interior of certain subsets of Baire spaces is equivalent to this object. This object may result from in nite intersection of   unbounded nested closed sets, but not from in nite intersection of bounded nested closed sets. This set is always clopen in every topology. For ten points, identify this set whose complement is the universal set and which has no elements.

TOSSUP: A function determines one of these if it satis es the properties of homogene- ity, bisymmetry, and cyclicity. One of these is called major if the function which determines it takes only one argument. One of these called the mittenpunkt is the center of a Mandart inellipse, and another named for Lemoine is the inter- section of the symmedians. The nine-point one of these is de ned as the center of the nine-point circle, and the   Euler line passes through several of these. One of these is the intersection of the altitudes and is the  ortho  one. For ten points, identify these special points with relation to certain shapes, which are exempli ed by one pre xed  circum-  and the centroid?

TOSSUP: If omega is taken to be the set of natural numbers, then this entity sub omega is a model for set theory without the axiom of in nity, while this entity sub omega plus omega is a model for Zermelo set theory. This entity is constructed by trans nite induction over the ordinal numbers. This entity is de ned to be the union of all stages, which consist of all sets with the same rank and form the cumulative   hierarchy. For ten points, identify this entity symbolized V , the class of hereditary and well-founded sets and foundation for modern set theories.

TOSSUP: Netto's conjecture states that the probability that any two elements of the nth of these groups generate the group goes to 3/4 as n goes to in nity. Jordan's theorem on these groups states that a primitive subgroup of the nth of these groups is equal to either that group or the nth   alternating group if it contains a q-cycle. These groups are transitive, and the number of conjugacy classes of the nth of these groups is equal to the partition function of n. These groups are generally non-abelian, and the nth of these groups is a permutation group of order n!. For ten points, identify these groups, the nth of which is the group of permutations with n elements.

TOSSUP: This process is performed with respect to the Jordan measure, and can only be performed on an indicator function of a set if that set is Jordan measurable. This process is generalized by a similarly named one called the  gauge  one, and it cannot be performed on any function which has more than countably many points at which it is discontinuous. This process is equivalent to a similar process named for   Darboux, and the Lebesgue monotone convergence theorem fails to hold for this process. This process uses tagged partitions in order to compute intermediate values, which are called  sums  and named for the same person as this process. For ten points, identify this  rst rigorously-de ned integral.

TOSSUP: The manipulation of these objects in order to produce certain expressions is known as index gymnastics. Riemann and Christo el name one of these objects used to express the curvature of manifolds. Contraction is an operation reducing the total order of these objects by two, and the most commonly used notation for these objects is Ricci calculus. Bilinear forms are examples of these objects which also include bivectors and linear transformations. One of these objects named for Cauchy is used to describe the stress of a material, and these objects describe linear relations like the inner product and cross product. For ten points, identify these objects which generalize vectors and matrices. 

TOSSUP: If a coordinate plane is de ned with both axes ranging over the limited ver- sion of this set, then the parallel postulate is violated. One function de ned on this set is the standard part function, which returns a real number which is an element of the monad of the input; that function is a ring homomorphism from the limited version of this set to the real numbers. This set can be constructed through ultrapowers on real sequences, and this set is subject to the transfer principle, which means statements in rst-order logic true about the real num- bers are true about it. Non-standard analysis is the study of, for ten points, what extension of the real numbers which includes in nitesimals? 

TOSSUP: This operation, when applied to a one-form, gives a result described by the comma derivative. The conjugate this method, an algorithm for nding the local minima of a function, is only possible if this operation can be computed. The convective operator is de ned as a product of a vector eld and the symbol for this operation. The symbol used to describe this operation, when squared, instead describes the Laplacian; that symbol is known as nabla . A vector eld is known as conservative if it can be expressed as this operation of another eld. For ten points, identify this operation from multivariable calculus, which expresses the slope of a multidimensional scalar eld and is symbolized with an upside-down delta. 

TOSSUP: A blog post by Philippe Guglielmetti used this thing to determine which numbers are interesting and which are not. This entity uses the keyword dumb to describe things which are unimportant or do not relate to mathe- matics, and it uses cofr to describe continued fraction expansions. One entry in this entity consists of the nth term of the nth entry in this entity. The 100,000th entry in this entity counts the number of marks on the Ishango bone, while the rst counts the number of groups of order n. For ten points, identify this database created by Neil Sloane which catalogues certain lists of numbers. 

TOSSUP: Tarski names a type of group also described by the same term as this group which is an in nite group G such that any proper subgroup of the group is a cyclic group with order a  xed prime number. Prime numbers which divide the order of this group are called supersingular; there are 15 such primes. A certain collection of groups is divided into  pariahs  which are not subgroups of this one, and the  happy family  which is. This group can be built from two out of three of the Fischer group Fi24, the Conway group Co1, and its own    Baby  version. This group was initially constructed as the automorphism group of       a 196,884-dimensional algebra. For ten points, identify this largest of the 26 sporadic  nite simple groups.

TOSSUP: A complex continuous version of this question involves a fractal graph which encodes discrete information about this question's traditional statement. A 1981 paper by Lynn Garner showed that a negative answer to this question must involve thousands of terms. Paul ErdÂ®s declared about this question that  mathematics may not be ready for such problems . The generalized version of this conjecture includes negative numbers and involves four terminal   cycles rather than just one. This question asks whether the iterated Syracuse func- tion of every integer is equal to one for su ciently many iterations. For ten           points, identify this conjecture in number theory which asks whether iterating the operation of multiplying odd numbers by 3 and adding 1 and dividing even numbers by two will always lead to the cycle (1, 2, 4).

TOSSUP: The octahedral group has this order, and the largest Mathieu group is designated with this subscript. The 4-dimensional regular polytope with this many cells is self-dual, is constructed of octahedral cells, and has no direct 3- dimensional analogue. An arrangement of unit spheres in this many dimensions can be constructed using the binary Golay code, uniquely solves the kissing number problem, and is known as the   Leech lattice. This number, which is divisible by every positive integer less than its square root, is one less than a perfect square and three less than a perfect cube. For ten points, identify this number, equal to four times the smallest perfect number as well as itself being equal to 4!.

TOSSUP: A theorem named for this mathematician states that polyhedra with con- gruent corresponding faces are congruent. An equation named for this mathe- matician has a set of solutions which was found by Georg Hamel, and describes   additive functions. This mathematician names a quantity that is the con- volution of two power series -- his  product . The theorem stating that the contour integral of a complex-valued holomorphic function is zero is called this mathematician's integral theorem. This mathematician, with Schwartz, names an inequality relating to inner products. For ten points, identify this French mathematician, whose namesake sequences all converge in the real numbers.

TOSSUP: The fraction of the numbers less than x with this property which are primeis on the order of ln ln ln x . Belphegor numbers are examples of this type of lnln xnumber which contain the string 666. Lychrel numbers are numbers which are not known to produce one of these numbers after repeated application of the reverse-then-add sequence; the smallest such number is 196. The  rst 9 Demlo numbers have this property because the nth Demlo number is the square of the nth repunit. All of these numbers with an even number of digits are divisible by   11. For ten points, identify this property held by numbers which are the same backwards as they are forwards.

TOSSUP: This man's doctoral thesis was entitled  Discrete groups, analytic groups and Poincaré series . This man published an article in Seed magazine entitled  Prime Numbers Get Hitched  which related the number 42 to the Riemann zeta function. In one of this man's books, he recounts a trip to the Alhambra palace in which he attempts to  nd examples of every symmetry group; the book also describes the quest to categorize all the  nite simple groups and was entitled Finding   Moonshine in the UK and Symmetry: A Journey into the Patterns of Nature in the US. This man's  rst book tells the history of prime number mathematics and the Riemann hypothesis. For ten points, identify this Oxford university professor and author of The Music of the Primes.

TOSSUP: A number is only an antimorph if the Pell equation has this property. A Lie group has this property if it is connected and its Lie algebra commutator series eventually vanishes. The Feit-Thompson theorem showed that every  nite group of odd order has this property, and the fact that the symmetric group does not have this property for n = 5 and above is the reason that the   Abel- Ru ni theorem holds. Galois's theorem states that an algebraic equation has this property if and only if its group also has this property. The halting problem has this property for machines with fewer than four states but does not have it in general. For ten points, identify this property held by equations to which one can  nd the roots.

TOSSUP: The Dirichlet distribution is the conjugate prior for the distribution named for this kind of data, and the probit regression technique is used for a subset of this kind of data. The techniques of dummy coding, e ects coding, and contrast coding are used to analyze this kind of data, which is described by distributions also termed generalized   Bernoulli distributions. This kind of data is termed dichotomous if it has only two possible values. The act of treating continuous data as if it were this kind of data is called discretization. For ten points, identify this type of statistical data exempli ed by blood type or country of origin which can only take on one of a  xed set of values.

TOSSUP: A transformation is called ergodic if its invariant subsets all have this property. This term describes a  ber bundle isomorphic to the cross product of the base space and a  ber. A Brunnian link consists of a set of linked loops such            that every proper sublink has this property; the simplest example of one is the Borromean rings. The loop described by this adjective takes every point to its basepoint. Zeros of the Riemann zeta function lying at   odd negative integers are described by this adjective. Topological spaces described by this adjective are also called indiscrete and contain only two open sets. For ten points, identify this adjective which describes the group with one element, or a proof which is easy.

TOSSUP: This question was answered a rmatively by Hilbert in 1909, but his proof was nonconstructive. Liouville showed that the fourth power case for this ques- tion had an upper bound of 53; Hardy and Littlewood showed that it was 19 for all su ciently large integers, and that solution was extended to all integers in 1986. A special case of the solution to this problem can be proved using Minkowski's theorem; that special case is the Lagrange   four-squares theorem. For ten points, identify this mathematical problem which asked of every natural number k whether there was a number s such that every integer can be written as at most s kth powers.

TOSSUP: A Mesoamerican version of this device was known as the nepohualtzintzin and was used by people known as temalpouhqueh. Skilled operators of these devices can perform a technique known as anzan, where they visualize these devices in order to perform mental calculation without using them. The use of these computing devices in Rome originated the use of the word  calculus , originally the word for   pebble, to refer to computation. The suanpan and the soroban are examples of, for ten points, what sort of arithmetical computing aid which makes use of beads on wires?

TOSSUP: Sermanet and LeCun used multi-scale convolutional networks to recognize these objects, and a 2003 article in Image and Vision Computing by de la Es- calera develops an early neural network to recognize these objects. Dan Ciresan developed a neural network that won a 2011 prize for recognizing these objects. The Swedish business Mapillary is facilitating the computer recognition of these objects by building a crowdsourced alternative to Google   Street View. These objects could be replaced with a system called IVS, and their recognition is important to the operation of self-driving cars. For ten points, identify these objects which say things like  New York City 30 Miles  and  Right Lane Exit Only  to drivers.

TOSSUP: The  rst engineered one of these things made use of the 17c/45 reaction in its construction. One of these was discovered in 2016 with speed c/10 and is known as the copperhead. Flotillae of these things often involve overweight ones which cannot survive otherwise. The four smallest examples of these things include their lightweight, middleweight, and heavyweight types, and if one of these things leaves debris behind, it is known as a pu er. These things can be emitted by   guns, which include a famous example named for Gosper. The glider is the most common example of, for ten points, what objects in Conway's Game of Life which move by returning to their original state but in a different location?

TOSSUP: The Gershgorin Circle Theorem guarantees that each of these will be con- tained in a certain set of disks. The Lanczos algorithm is used to compute these non-vector quantities, and Lyapunov's First Theorem gives necessary and su cient conditions to ensure that the real parts of these quantities will be neg- ative. These values are invariant under similarity transformations, and Schur's inequalities relate these values to the entries of the   matrix from which they are calculated. These values are also known as characteristic roots because they are the roots of a matrix's characteristic polynomial. For ten points, identify these scalars associated with a matrix and corresponding to vectors with the same pre x.

TOSSUP: All recti able polyominoes are examples of these things. They're not fractals, but the Sierpinski triangle and Gosper island are both examples of these things. Karl Scherer and George Sicherman have discovered pentagonal examples of these things, in addition to the oldest-known pentagonal one, the sphinx. The term for these things was introduced by Simon Golomb as a pun on the name of a certain class of   animals. All parallelograms and triangles are examples of these things with order 4, and all examples of these things lead to a tiling of the plane. For ten points, identify these shapes which can be tiled by identical smaller copies of themselves.

TOSSUP: Jessen's [this] icosahedron is a shaky polyhedron in which faces of an icosa- hedron are replaced by isosceles triangles. Polynomials are described using this term if they obey the relationship that the integral from a to b of w(x)pm(x)pn(x) is equal to cn times the Kronecker delta of m and n. Circles in the plane are the group orbits of groups described by this term, of which the special kind is the component containing the identity. This condition for linear transformations can be expressed as aijaik is equal to the Kronecker delta of j and k. Three confocal conic   surfaces have this property, which can be attained by at most three collections of surfaces in three-dimensional space. For ten points, identify this property held by two members of a space if their inner product is zero.

TOSSUP: A ring is called quasilocal if it is a unit ring with  nitely many maximal ideals and also has this property. The snake lemma and nine lemma are lem- mas pertaining to diagrams described by this term; such diagrams describe a collection of maps and consist of letters or other symbols joined by arrows. The Wolfram Language attribute for this property is    Orderless . This property is always held by the addition operation in a ring, but not by the multiplica- tion operation. Inner products like the dot product have this property, but the cross product does not. For ten points, identify this property held by a binary operation ∗ if a ∗ b = b ∗ a for all a and b.

TOSSUP: The Arnoldi method is an application of this process to the Krylov sequence. This process allows the existence of a smooth deformation retraction of one type of Steifel manifold into the other. The HJLS algorithm is numerically unstable because of its reliance on this process, which is also numerically unstable as shown by Golub and Van Loan. This process can be used to diagonalize a nondegenerate symmetric bilinear form, and it can generate the Legendre   polynomials over the open interval (−1,1) with weighting function 1. For ten points, identify this process used to generate an orthogonal basis from any linearly independent set.

TOSSUP: An investigation of a method named for this mathematician led David Rob- bins and Howard Rumsey to the alternating sign matrix conjecture. This man proposed a voting method using swaps to extend the Condorcet method, and was responsible for the  rst printed proof of the Rouché-Capelli theorem. This man formulated syllogisms to train students in symbolic logic. This man names a method of  nding the determinant of a matrix in which one  rst  nds the determinants of every 2-by-2 submatrix; this is his namesake   condensation. For ten points, identify this mathematician and author who pseudonymously wrote Through the Looking-Glass and the poem Jabberwocky.

TOSSUP: The fourth cumulant is equal to the kurtosis times this quantity squared minus three times this quantity squared. The Lexis ratio is a ratio of two versions of this value, one of which is calculated from a set of Lexis trials, and another of which is calculated assuming Bernoulli trials. Bessel's correction is multiplied by this quantity to obtain the expected value of another version of this quantity. This quantity, which is equal to the second central   moment, is de ned t as the expected value of(X − μ)2. This quantity is the square of the standard deviation. For ten points, identify this quantity, which is a measure of the level to which a data set is dispersed from its mean.

TOSSUP: The expected value of a random variable has this property, but its variance does not. This property is held by a homothecy centered at the origin. A func- tion satisfying Cauchy's functional equation has this property if it is continuous at at least one point, if it is bounded on any interval, or if it is monotone on any interval. Functions must be   additive and homogenous of degree 1 to satisfy this property. This property is held by di erentiation and integration with a  xed starting point. This property fails to be held by polynomials whose degree exceeds 1. For ten points, identify this property held by a function like f(x)=3x.

TOSSUP: This country's  rst Antarctic expedition was named for one of its mathemati- cians. A mathematician from this country names a question mark function with fractal properties. Another mathematician from this country names a plane also known as the inversive plane. A mathematician from this country names the diagrams used to represent partially ordered sets, while another mathemati- cian from this country names   surfaces which are one-dimensional complex manifolds. One mathematician from this country names the cgs unit of  ux density, while a physicist from this country names the SI unit of resistance. For ten points, identify this country home to Bernard Riemann and Carl Friedrich Gauss.

TOSSUP: George Bergman constructed a p-adic analogue of this space. This space fails to satisfy the Lindelöf condition and does not possess a countable dense subset; moreover, despite the fact that this space is locally compact, it is not paracompact. This space, which is not second countable, is formed from the cartesian product of ω1 with [0,1). Any open interval (a,b) of this space is homeomorphic to the interval (0,1) in the reals, but the entire space is not homeomorphic to any subset of any   Rn. For ten points, identify this one- dimensional manifold locally homeomorphic to the reals and formed from an uncountable number of half-open intervals.

TOSSUP: The criss-cross and ellipsoid algorithms are methods for doing this process, for which Khachiyan developed the  rst polynomial-time algorithm. Karmakar's al- gorithm, a highly e cient algorithm for this process, is an interior point method. By adding slack variables, equations in this process can be converted into aug- mented form, allowing the application of the simplex algorithm, which operates by moving between the vertices of the   feasible region until it  nds the solu- tion. For ten points, identify this process by which a linear function of several variables is optimized over a region constrained by several inequalities.

TOSSUP: The Lebesgue di erentiation theorem is a generalization of this statement, al- though in order for the converse to be satis ed one must use Henstock-Kurzweil integration. The time evolution of integrals generalizes this statement in speci c contexts, and the gradient and divergence theorems generalize this statement.   Stokes's theorem is the multidimensional generalization of this statement which formally establishes that antidi erentiation and integration are the same thing. For ten points, identify this central result which states that the derivative of the integral of a function is that function.

TOSSUP: Pencil and paper ready. This number is equal to the magnitude of the gradient of xy + yz at the point (1, 4, 1). The trigonal trapezohedron has thisx3many faces, and the volume of a tetrahedron with side length x is THISÂ·√2 . Theintegral from 2 to 5 of x2 is three more than the square of this number. Thisnumber is equal to the dot product of the vectors ⟨5,2⟩ and ⟨4,−7⟩.   Thegeometric mean of 24 and this number is 12, and the sine of π over this numberis 1 . For ten points, identify this number equal to the number of vertices of an 2octahedron and the cube root of 216.

TOSSUP: Kochanek and Bartels name one of these which is equipped with continuity, tension, and bias parameters, and the centripetal Catmull-Rom one lacks cusps or self-intersections. The Irwin-Hall distribution is an example of one of these, and one of these of degree m is called perfect if its mth derivative is equal to plus or minus 1. The cubic Hermite type of these are de ned by their values and  rst derivatives at a certain set of points, and the non-uniform rational B type of these is commonly used in   computer graphics. Bézier curves are an example of, for ten points, what kind of object which consists of smoothly connected piecewise polynomial functions?

TOSSUP: One holder of this position wrote The Elements of Algebra in Ten Books and was notably blind. Another holder of this position discovered, with Schwarz, that the anomaly in type I string theory cancels. A holder of this position names a theorem relating the surface integral of the curl of a vector  eld to the line integral over its boundary. A holder of this position developed a  di erence engine , while another names a   delta function. The second holder of this position names three laws of motion. A Brief History of Time was written by, for ten points, a holder of what Cambridge professorship held by Charles Babbage, Isaac Newton, and Stephen Hawking?

TOSSUP: The possible ones of these on some set form a lattice ordered by set inclusion called Con, and if a set is accompanied by one of these then it is referred to as a setoid. Equality is the  nest one of these on any set, and if a construct        is Euclidean and re exive then it is one of these. This kind of construct is a symmetric preorder and a transitive tolerance relation, and these objects   partition a set into their namesake classes. Examples of this type of relation include geometric similarity and modular congruence. For ten points, identify this kind of relation which must be re exive, symmetric, and transitive.

TOSSUP: A philosophical dialogue by this man begins with a man praying to God to absolve him of free will and is called  Is God a Taoist?  One of this man's books provides the reader with an introduction to combinatory logic in which combina- tors are depicted as birds that repeat songs; that book is To Mock a Mockingbird. This man's Forever Undecided contains   conundrums centered around unde- cidability, and his Satan, Cantor, and In nity focuses on set-theoretic concepts of in nity. For ten points, identify this logician, many of whose works, including What is the Name of This Book?, are collections of logic puzzles.

TOSSUP: The number of elements in the free monoid described by this term is given by Pn k=0  n k  Q k i=1 (k −i+ 1)2^i. Numbers are said to be this if they are expressible in the form ( n/k ) k^n−k ; this is because the sum from k = 0 to n of such numbers gives the number of functions with this property on a set with n elements. Functions having this property include functions mapping sets to their closure and vector space projections. Absorbing elements have this property for the binary operations under which they absorb; and identity elements always have this property. For ten points, identify this general property which is held by a member x of a group if xx = x.

TOSSUP: The polar version of this function is applied to n-dimensional parallelotopesand simplices. The integral from zero to in nity of this function of xn is equal       to Γ 1+ 1 +THIS  π  . The integral of the inverse of this function of x is n 2n  √equal to 1 − x2 +xÂ·THIS−1(x)+C. The   hyperbolic version of this function ex −e−x ıxis equal to 2 . This function of x times ı is the imaginary part of e , andthis function's second derivative is equal to its negative. For ten points, identify this trigonometric function equal to the reciprocal of cosecant.

TOSSUP: With Tricomi, this mathematician names the partial di erential equation uxx + xuyy = 0. In music theory, this man and Fokker name any musical scale whose pitches are generated from products of a set of prime numbers. There are either 65 or 66 of this man's idoneal numbers, depending on the truth of the Riemann Hypothesis. An identity named for this man states that the productof two sums of four   squares is itself a sum of four squares, and this man names, with Mascheroni, a constant equal to the limit of the di erence between the harmonic series and the natural logarithm. For ten points, identify this Swiss mathematician, a formula named for whom is used to de ne complex exponentiation.

TOSSUP: This statement can be proved by using the fact that the game of hex cannot end in a draw. This statement, which is equivalent to the Knaster-Kuratowski- Mazurkiewicz lemma, has a generalized version named for Schauder. This result is used in the proof of the Borsk-Ulam theorem. This result stemmed from a novel proof of the   hairy ball theorem using homotopy, and its  rst proof relied on the notion of degree. This statement is equivalent to a statement about labeling the edges of triangles called Sperner's Lemma. For ten points, identify this theorem stating that any continuous map from a closed ball to itself must map at least one point to itself.

TOSSUP: Barban's constant and Murata's constant are de ned as products over these numbers. Pépin's theorem gives conditions for Fermat numbers to hold this property. If the radix of a numeral system has this property, then there are an in nite number of integers with this property ending with each nonzero digit. Bertrand's postulate, which was proved by Chebyshev and later by   ErdÂ®s, states that for any integer n there is always at least one number with this property between n and 2n. These numbers are all congruent to 1 or 5 mod 6. For ten points, identify these numbers which have two distinct postive divisors.

TOSSUP: Daniell names an axiomatized alternative to this process. Fatou's lemma relates this operation on the limit inferior of a sequence of functions to the limit inferior of the sequence of this operation of those functions. A theorem states that if a sequence of functions fn is all less than a function g on which this process can be performed, then this process can be performed on the limit of that sequence; that is the   dominated convergence theorem. This process is named for a mathematician who also names the measure on which it is based. For ten points, identify this more powerful generalization of the Riemann integral.

TOSSUP: his man wrote a book entitled  Extraction of the Jewish Era  describing the Jewish calendar. This man's  Book of the Description of the Earth  includes a list of locations by their coordinates. This non-Fibonacci man's second major work, on arithmetic, survives only in its Latin translation, which is commonly referred to as  Dixit [this man] , and introduced   Arabic numerals to the West- ern world. This mathematician wrote a book in which he described methods for solving quadratics; the word  algebra  comes from the name of that book. For ten points, identify this Arabic mathematician whose name is the origin of the English word  algorithm .

TOSSUP: Eight of the eleven rings with the same number of elements as this group have its operation as their additive operation, and all of this group's 5 subgroups are normal. This group names an a cappella singing group at Northwestern University best known for their song  Finite Simple Group of Order Two . This group is isomorphic to   D2, the second dihedral group, and to Z2 Ã— Z2. This group is equal to the symmetry group of a rectangle which is not a square. This group is the smallest non-cyclic group, and every element's square is equal to the identity. For ten points, identify this group with four elements named after a mathematician who also names a bottle.

TOSSUP: 12. Description acceptable. It has nothing to do with AI, but an article on Nick Bostrom's website entitled  What we should say to the Skeptic  begins by asking  How can we be justi ed in believing  one answer to this question. In An Enquiry Concerning Human Understanding, Hume states that a negative              answer to this question is  no less intelligible  than a positive answer. Pierre- Simon Laplace attempted to answer this question with his rule of succession, but concluded that it was a misapplication of that principle, because the true answer  is far greater for him who, seeing in the totality of phenomena the principle regulating the   days and seasons, realizes that nothing at present moment can arrest the course of it . For ten points, identify this inquiry about the chances of a certain celestial body's presence in the sky.

TOSSUP: Gelfond's theorem gives conditions for the number ab to have this property, and the Gelfond-Schneider constant and Champernowne's constant have this property. A function has this property if it cannot be written as a  nite se- quence of addition, multiplication, and root extraction.   Liouville's constant, whose decimal expansion has a zero in the nth decimal place unless n is a fac- torial number, was the  rst number proven to have this property. Hermite's theorem extablished that this property is possessed by e. For ten points, iden- tify this property held by numbers which are not the solution to any polynomial equations.

TOSSUP: The term  cathetus  is an archaic term for certain parts of these objects. Fermat's theorem about these shapes says that their area cannot be a perfect square unless at least one side has irrational length; numbers that can be the area of a rational-sided one of these shapes are called congruent. Polyaboloes consist of special cases of these shapes joined at their edges, and one of these shapes is called primitive if its side lengths are relatively prime. The midpoint of the longest side of one of these shapes is equidistant from all of its   vertices, and if one of these shapes is inscribed in a circle then its longest side is a diameter. For ten points, identify these shapes whose side lengths obey the Pythagorean Theorem.

TOSSUP: A Hecke algebra is spanned by the double this space of the group it cor- responds to, and Gelfand pairs consist of a group and a subgroup such that the subgroup's double these commute. Showing that each of these has the same number of elements is crucial to the proof of   Lagrange's theorem, which guar- antees that the order of a subgroup of a group divides the order of the group. A ne subspaces of a vector space are these, and if a subgroup H is normal, then its set of left these and its set of right these will be equal. For ten points, identify these structures in group theory where a subgroup H is multiplied on either the left or the right by an element g.

TOSSUP: This man designed a large ship, named after his home, which only sailed once. In Cicero's De re publica, Marcus Claudius Marcellus takes to Rome two devices built by this man which show the movements of the Sun, Moon, and planets. This man wrote a treatise on the behavior of right paraboloids in various uids, On Floating Bodies. A palimpsest named for this man contains his The Method of Mechanical Theorems, in which he describes his methods for solving problems with a procedure based on centers of mass. The Quadrature of the Parabola was written by, for ten points, what ancient mathematician who lived in Syracuse and invented a namesake screw? 

TOSSUP: The Shah distribution consists of the sum of equally spaced horizontal transformations of this function, which is also known as its namesake's comb . The Sokhotski-Plemelj theorem relates this function to the Cauchy principle value of the reciprocal function. This function can be expressed as the derivative of the Heaviside step function. This function is the limit of a sequence of strongly peaked functions, and Kronecker names a discrete analog of this function. The integral of this function over an interval is zero unless that interval contains the origin, in which case it is one. For ten points, identify this function equal to zero everywhere but the origin, at which it is equal to infinity. 

TOSSUP: Russell Rogers and Leonard D'Andrea were granted a patent for these things under the name  Changeable Amusement Devices and the Like.  Les Pook has written two books about these things, including Serious Fun with [these things] and [These Things] Inside Out. The Tuckerman traverse is a technique which is used to expose all of one of these things. The  hexahexa  type of these things has six hexagonal faces, and is   folded from a strip of paper divided into eighteen equilateral triangles. The subject of Martin Gardner's  rst-ever Mathematical Games column was, for ten points, what objects which can be folded to reveal faces which were not originally shown on their back or front?

TOSSUP: The left or sub- version of this function counts the number of derangements of n objects. A conjecture of ErdÂ®s states that there are only three pairs of numbers (m, n) such that THIS(n) + 1 = m2. The Pochhammer symbol is also known as this function's    rising  type. The exponential type of this function is de ned by the recurrence relation an = nan−1 . This function's double version is actually smaller because it only includes odd or even numbers in the computation of its output. This function of n gives the number of permutations of n objects. For ten points, identify this function denoted by an exclamation point.

TOSSUP: In the equilic kind of these objects, extending two line segments will result in a 60-degree angle. The tangential kind of these objects is distinguished by possessing an incircle, and the area of a tangential one of these objects is equal to the inradius times the semiperimeter. Bretschneider's formula is an analog of Heron's formula for computing the area of these objects, and   Brahmagupta's formula is a special case used to compute the area of the cyclic kind of these      objects, which are governed by Ptolemy's theorem. All of these objects tile the plane, and lozenges and kites are special cases of, for ten points, what class of geometric shapes which include trapezoids and rectangles.

TOSSUP: If a Lie group has this property, every representation of it is equivalent to a unitary representation; Lie groups have this property if their parameters vary over a closed interval. The space Rn can be endowed with this property by adding a point at   in nity. The Hilbert cube has this property by Tychono 's theorem, which states that this property is productive, that is, the product of any number of objects with this property also has this property. Any  nite space has this property. If a space is Hausdor , then any set in that space with this property is closed. For ten points, identify this property held by a set if every covering of it with open sets has a  nite subcover.

TOSSUP: Haga's theorem shows how to use this process to generate an arbitrary rational number. Maekawa's theorem relates the number of  mountains  and  valleys  obtained through this process. The Huzita-Hatori axioms formalize what can be done using this process, which can solve third-degree equations and therefore is capable of doubling the cube and trisecting the angle.   Kawasaki's theorem governs this process by showing that alternating angles around a vertex must sum to 180 degrees, and it also determines when the outcome of this process can be  attened. For ten points, identify this Japanese practice which can be used for geometric construction as well as for art to create things like paper cranes.

TOSSUP: The Calkin-Wilf and Stern-Brocot trees will eventually generate every ele-ment of this set. A triangle whose side lengths and area are both members ofthis set is called Heronian. Niven's theorem restricts the values of the sine ofx if it, and x , are both members of this set, extensions of which are called   πalgebraic number  elds. Every  eld of characteristic zero has this set as a sub- eld. This set is countable, however, it is dense in the reals under the standardtopology. For ten points, identify this set of numbers expressible as a where a band b are integers.

TOSSUP: The non-associative system of Cracovian multiplication was introduced to help manually compute solutions to these things. The Moore-Penrose pseudoin- verse can be used to solve these things, or approximate solutions if none exist. Levinson recursion can be used to solve examples of these things if they can be expressed using a Toeplitz   matrix. These things can be solved using Gaus- sian elimination on augmented matrices or by using Cramer's rule, and these things can either have one, none, or in nitely many solutions. For ten points, identify these sets of statements which describe how sums of variables are equal to constants.

TOSSUP: Nevanlinna and Pick name a problem of performing this process on the complex unit disk, and Abel and Goncharov name a type of this process which matches higher derivatives. Newton names a polynomial used for this process the coe cients of which are calculated using divided di erences.   Runge's phenomenon occurs when this process becomes less accurate as the degree of the polynomials used in it increases, and can be avoided by using unequal intervals. The simplest method of doing this, the linear method, connects consecutive data points with lines. For ten points, identify this process from numerical analysis in which a data set is   filled in  by a function.

TOSSUP: The Plücker matrix, which has this property, characterizes a straight line in projective space. The Pfa an of a matrix is only nonvanishing if the matrix has this property, and the square of the Pfa an of a matrix with this property is the determinant. Matrices with this property and odd dimension must be noninvertible by Jacobi's theorem. Any matrix can be written as the sum of a   symmetric matrix and a matrix with this property, and matrices with this property must have zero on the diagonal. For 10 points, identify this property held by matrices whose negative is their transpose

TOSSUP: The Chakravala method is used for  nding solutions to these things. The Erdos-Strauss conjecture states that a certain set of these things all have so- lutions. Hilbert's tenth problem asked whether all of these things could be solved, and   Matiyasevich proved that no general algorithm for solving these things existed. Pell's equation is one of these things, which can be solved us- ing the Hasse principle. Fermat's Last Theorem states that no solutions exist to a speci c class of these equations. For ten points, identify these equations to which only the integer solutions are relevant to study, named for a classical mathematician from Alexandria.

TOSSUP: The Reaction in Germany attributes this statement to the Juste-Milieu among similar statements attributed to the Left and the Right, and the narra- tor of Notes from Underground describes this statement as  sometimes a very charming thing too . Eugene Lyons's Assignment in Utopia includes a chapter titled after this statement. Victor Hugo lamented popular support for Napoleon III by declaring  Now, cause seven million  ve hundred thousand voters to de- clare that [this statement is true] . In another novel, the narrator declares  the   Party would announce [this], and you would have to believe it ; that is George Orwell's 1984. For ten points, identify this false statement about the addition of even primes.

TOSSUP: 16. The Gömböc is a shape whose stable and unstable points of equilibriumhave this property. A graph is said to be chromatically this if it is not chromat-ically equivalent to any other graph to which it is not isomorphic. Solutions toLangford's problem modulo 3 and 4 have this property up to digit reversal. Aprime number p is said to have this property if 1 is a repeating decimal with pperiod n, and for no   other prime number q does 1 have period n. Up to qrotations and re ections, a solution to the six queens puzzle has this property.    For ten points, identify this property of being the only member of a certain set or solution to a certain problem.

TOSSUP: Erret Bishop argued that this statement is constructively acceptable because its namesake concept is implied by the meaning of existence. This statement implies Krull's theorem and ensures that every partially ordered set has a maxi- mal antichain. This statement implies that every vector space has a   basis and that every product of compact spaces is compact. This statement is equivalent to the statement that every set has a well-ordering, as well as Zorn's lemma. For ten points, identify this controversial statement in set theory stating that the Cartesian product of nonempty sets is nonempty, which makes up the C in ZFC.

TOSSUP: Simon Stevin proved this result for polynomials by constructing the decimal expansion of a solution, and a function is said to be Darboux if it ful lls the property laid out in this result. Bolzano's theorem is equivalent to this result, which is true because continuous functions take connected sets to connected sets. This theorem fails to be true for the rationals because they are not con- nected; for example, although there exist rationals a,b such that a2 = 0 and b2 = 4, there exists no rational c such that c2 = 2. For ten points, identify this result from real analysis stating that any function from the interval [a,b] to the real line must assume every value between f(a) and f(b). 

TOSSUP: One common source of inconsistencies in this concept is the axiom schema of unrestricted comprehension, which leads to things like the Burali-Forti para- dox and Curry's paradox. Paul Halmos wrote a book titled after this concept, although the book does not describe this concept because it presents an ax- iomatic construction of its subject. Russell's paradox natually arises in this system, and more advanced systems that replaced this one include one named for Zermelo and Fraenkel. For ten points, identify this system of set theory driven by an intuitional understanding and possessing no formal underpinning. 

TOSSUP: The original de nition of topological spaces included as an axiom that all spaces have this property, which a space has if it is both preregular and Kolmogorov. A space is said to be completely or functionally this if any two points in it can be separated by a continuous function. If a space has this property, then limits of nets and  lters on it are unique, and the intersection of all closed neighborhoods of x is equal to the   singleton {x}. This property's namesake also notably names a fractal dimension. For ten points, identify this property held by a topological space if any two distinct points in it have disjoint neighborhoods.

TOSSUP: The Eilenburg-Mazur swindle involves the misapplication of one form of this process which takes a limit of arithmetic means. One formula for doing this is co-named for Plana and is related to one named for Lambert. Watson's theorem and Carleman's theorem guarantee the optimality of one method of doing this which has exponential and integral types and is named for Borel. It's not integration, but a method of doing this  by   parts  is often also named for Abel. A notational convention in physics for writing this process is named for Einstein. Cesaro and Euler name types of, for ten points, what sort of process which involves  nding the limit of a series?

TOSSUP: Hodge et al. showed that this property's namesake coe cient is equal to 1 AD times the double integral over D ofAD(x,y). A set is called a cone with thisproperty if for all x,y in the set and scalars a and b it's the case that ax+by is also in the set. Every simple polygon has at least one mouth unless it has this property. A set is   star-this if there exists a point P such that the line segment XP is contained in the set for every point X in the set. The this hull of a set is the intersection of all sets with this property containing it. For ten points, identify this property which is held by polygons with no exterior diagonals.

TOSSUP: A team from Southampton University made 60 entries into a competition for this game, which colluded with one another to ensure that a few of them would sweep the top spots. Robert Axelrod's book The Evolution of Cooperation describes a number of di erent strategies for this game, and concludes that they must be nice, retaliating, forgiving, and non-envious. William H. Press and Freeman Dyson developed the theory of   zero-determinant strategies for the stochastic version of this game. Win-stay lose-switch, also known as Pavlov, and Anatol Rapaport's tit-for-tat are two strategies for, for ten points, what game in which a certain scenario about defecting or cooperating is played out repeatedly?

TOSSUP: A topological space on this entity is the initial object of the category of topological spaces with continuous maps, and this entity is the initial object of the category of sets and of the category of functions. The axiom of extension- ality guarantees this entity's uniqueness in Zermelo set theory. In the space of extended real numbers, this entity is the only set whose in mum is   greater than its supremum. Bourbaki introduced the most commonly used symbol for this entity, inspired by a letter in the Danish and Norwegian alphabets. Any statement about sets which begins  for any element of a set X  is true if the set X is this one. For ten points, identify this set which has cardinality zero because it has no elements.

TOSSUP: Hendrickson and Kolda described a method to use graph partitioning models to describe the execution of this process, while a 1994 book by Michael Quinn is entitled [this thing]: theory and practice. Erlang and Occam are programming languages which can be used for this. The extent to which an algorithm can5           be sped up by using this technique is described by   Amdahl's law. This technique is split into bit-level, instruction-level, and task types. Examples of hardware which executes this paradigm are clusters and multi-core processors. For ten points, identify this computing paradigm in which multiple operations are simultaneously executed by separate units.

TOSSUP: Saccheri proved a number of results about one of these constructs, but believed that his results demonstrated the impossibility of that construct's ex- istence. One of these constructs was modeled by Eugenio Beltrami using the Klein model, and the Cayley-Klein metric was used to describe these constructs. One of these constructs is also known as   Bolyai-Lobachevskian after the two mathematicians who independently discovered it. The pseudosphere models a section of one of these constructs. Euclid's  rst 28 propositions are true in all of, for ten points, what constructs formed by negating the parallel postulate, which include hyperbolic and elliptical kinds?

TOSSUP: 15. Steven Wiesner's proposal for unforgeable money unwittingly introduced the idea of these things. These things are operated on by logic gates which send their vectors through unitary transformations. The technique of superdense coding allows these things to possess additional information. Two of these things can6                             be   entangled in the Bell state, and information about these things can be gained through standard basis measurement. The Bloch sphere can be used to represent these objects, whose two basis states are ket 0 and ket 1. For ten points, identify these simplest units of information in quantum computers.

TOSSUP: This mathematician names the group of Minkowski spacetime isometries, and in dynamical systems, he names the intersection of a periodic orbit with a lower-dimensional subspace also named for him. This mathematician names a homology sphere which results from +1 surgery on the right-handed trefoil knot. This man received a prize from the King of Sweden for his work on the three-body problem, though he did not solve it. This man names a theorem asserting that every simply connected closed   3-manifold is homeomorphic to the 3-sphere, the only solved Millenium Problem. For ten points, identify this French mathematician whose namesake conjecture was proven by Grigori Perelman.

TOSSUP: Control systems described by this term use various methods of de-this- i cation including the constraint decision and generalized level set types. Goguen categories are the generalizations of this type of set to category theory. A spe- cial case of the sets described by this term are numbers described by this term, which have segmentally continuous membership   functions that are equal to one at at least one point. If the membership function of an element is equal to one, it is fully included in this type of set, and it is this type of member if its membership function is non-integral. This term is contrasted with crisp. For ten points, identify this term used to describe a type of logic where statements' truth values are taken from the interval [0, 1].

TOSSUP: The harmonic conjugate to a function f is another function g such that f + ıg satis es these equations. Any u and v which satisfy these equations must also satisfy Laplace's equation in two dimensions, and these equations guarantee that any function satisfying them is   conformal. These equations, which require that the second partial derivatives of u and v with respect to x equal the respective negatives of those derivatives with respect to y, ensure that the derivative is independent of the orientation from which it is taken. Holomorphic functions satisfy, for ten points, which equations which comprise the criterion for a function to be complex di erentiable?

TOSSUP: The Rochester Institute of Technology's hockey arena contains a depiction of these objects in the pavement in front of the entrance. The  rst of these things to be built was known as the Krämerbrücke, and two of them have since been incorporated into Leninsky prospekt. Three of these things allow individuals to travel to Kniephof, which notably contains the tomb of Immanuel Kant. Two of these things have not been rebuilt since their destruction in the bombing of   Kalinigrad, the city in which all of these things were located. For ten points, identify these conveyances which allow pedestrians to cross the Pregel River, and were the subject of a seminal problem in graph theory solved by Leonhard Euler.

TOSSUP: Simon Plou e, in 1998, gave a way to use this process to calculate the binary digits of numbers. The Mohr-Mascheroni theorem states that only one of the two things used for this process is necessary. Pierre Wantzel showed that a conjecture of Gauss pertaining to this process was true; that conjecture stated that this process could generate any   polygon whose odd prime factors were distinct Fermat primes; notably this means that polygons with 17 and 257 sides can be generated by this process. This process cannot be used to double the cube or trisect the angle. For ten points, identify this ancient Greek method of              geometrical construction which uses two devices, one to draw circles and one to draw lines.

TOSSUP: Strang's strange  gures are obtained by plotting functions with this property, and the zeta function with this property is equal to the polygamma function of e to the power of 2πıx. A near noble number has a continued fraction expansion with this property. It's not being nowhere di erentiable, but the Weierstrass function has this property. A function that can be represented as a generalized Fourier series is said to be almost this. A matrix has this property if some power of it is equal to   itself, and a function f is said to be Möbius this if it ful lls f(θ + π) = −f(θ). For ten points, identify this property held by a function if there exists a p such that f(a + p) = f(a) for every a.

TOSSUP: Cauchy names a theorem which is a partial converse to this statement, and a group for which the converse of this statement is true is called a CLT group; such groups must be solvable and all supersolvable groups are CLT groups. This statement can be used to show Wilson's theorem because it implies that groups of prime order are   cyclic. One proof of this statement uses the fact that a subgroup's left cosets are equivalence classes. This statement implies that the order of any element of a group divides the order of that group. For ten points, identify this theorem that states that for any subgroup H of a group G, the order of H divides the order of G.

TOSSUP: A book by J. Scott Carter about this thing describes it as  an Exercise in Diagrammatic Algebra . Rob Kusner proposed an optimal method of doing this based on saddle points in Willmore energy. A recent one of these things was discovered by Aitchison and called the holiverse. One class of these things, their  minimax  type, is constructed by using a half-way model such as Boy's surface or   Morin's surface. One method for doing this, Thurston's corrugations, was featured in a video produced by the Geometry Center entitled  Outside In . Stephen Smale  rst identi ed the possibility of, for ten points, what topological action in which a sphere is turned inside out?

TOSSUP: Howe's theorem concerns polytopes having this many vertices. Degen's identity guarantees that the product of two sums of this many squares can be written as a sum of this many squares. The  smooth  version of a polygon with this many sides is conjectured to be the least e ciently packable centrally symmetric shape, and any cubic curve passing through this many intersection points of two other cubic curves must pass through all such intersection points. Given any three circles, there are this many circles in the plane to which those three are all   tangent, and a regular polygon with side length x and this many sides has area (2 + 2√2)x2. For ten points, give the number of vertices of a cube.

TOSSUP: The construction of this set begins by constructing the integers, and then the dyadic rationals, and then the reals (including the non-dyadic rationals). In Von Neumann-Bernays-Gödel set theory, this set is the largest possible ordered  eld, of which every other ordered  eld is a sub eld. Elements of this set are de ned as equivalence classes of forms, which consist of two subsets of this set7            enclosed in curly braces and separated by a pipe. It's not the hyperreals, but this set contains positive elements smaller than any   real number, the simplest of which is denoted by epsilon. For ten points, identify this extension of the real numbers developed by John Horton Conway.

TOSSUP: One of these named for Stratonovich acts on semimartingales and processes, and one of these named for Haar is de ned for all Borel measurable functions. Khinchin and Denjoy name one of these de ned on noncontinuous functions which are the derivatives of continuous functions, and the Henstock-Kurzweil type is used to avoid singularities at a point. A generalization of one of these co-named for   Stieltjes is de ned as the Moore-Smith limit on a directed set of partitions. One of these is de ned as the limit of its namesake  sums , which are generated by partitioning the domain of a function. For ten points, identify this type of operation on functions, examples of which are named for Lebesgue and Riemann.

TOSSUP: The Seifert Conjecture says that any smooth nonzero one of these struc- tures has at least one closed orbit; it's true for Hopf maps but false in general. The Poincaré-Hopf theorem states that if one of these structures on a manifold ful lls certain conditions, then its index is equal to the Euler characteristic of that manifold. These structures are known as   central if they are invariant under orthogonal transformation around zero. These structures can be de ned generally as sections of the tangent bundle of a di erentiable manifold. These structures can be used to represent  ow lines. For ten points, identify these structures, operations on which include divergence and curl.

TOSSUP: A reddish-brown one of these objects appears in the background of the scene in the Simpsons episode  Treehouse of Horror VI  where Homer discovers the third dimension. Jim Arvo and Dave Kirk produced a ray-traced image showing six stone columns, on  ve of which are the Platonic solids and on the sixth of which is one of these objects; that image is titled  The Six Platonic Solids . The mathematical coordinates describing one of these objects were made available by Martin   Newell, and many graphics engines have one of these non-geometric objects as a graphics primitive. For ten points, identify this household item commonly used as a test or demonstration in computer graphics

TOSSUP: A vector on a Hilbert space is described by this term if there exists a bounded linear operator such that the orbits of the operator on the vector are dense in the Hilbert space. A group is called virtually this if it contains one of these groups, and that group has a nite number of cosets. For every n, there exists exactly one of these groups with n elements, and the only simple Abelian groups are the instances of these groups with non-composite order. These groups correspond to the rotational symmetries of a polygon. For ten points, identify this class of groups with one generator of which every element is a power. 

TOSSUP: This non-American mathematician names a theorem stating that a 1-to-1 correspondence exists between division rings of  nite index and unital algebras of  nite dimension. This mathematician also co-names a theorem stating that progressive functions have  xed points on posets. This mathematician intro- duced the dangerous bend symbol as well as the symbol for the empty set, and also coined the terms injective, surjective, and bijective. This mathematican's main work,   Elements of Mathematics, axiomatically constructs the core of modern mathematics. For ten points, identify this non-existent mathematician, the shared pseudonym of a collective of mainly French mathematicians.

TOSSUP: This thing is a special case of a similar thing named for Gelfand, and can be generalized to a discrete-time version over the integers. Plancherel's formula, which allows this thing to be extended to a unitary operator, relates the integral of the square of a function to the integral of the square of this thing of that function. This thing has the properties of translation, modulation, and time scaling. This thing's   fast type is an algorithm for computing its discrete type. For ten points, identify this means of expressing a function as a sum of trigonometric functions.

TOSSUP: The Hahn-Mazurkiewicz theorem states that these things can only exist in spaces ful lling certain criteria. These things, which can never be di erentiable, include one named for Osgood which is non-self-intersecting and one named for Gosper which is also known as the     owsnake  and covers the Gosper island. One of these things was constructed in order to create a surjective mapping from the unit interval to the unit square; that one is named for Peano, while another one with the same property is named for Hilbert. For ten points, identify this class of plane curves which completely cover a given multidimensional area.

TOSSUP: Pal Turan names one of these things used to prove the Hardy-Ramanujan theorem, and Viggo Brun names one of these things which was used to prove that the sum of the reciprocals of the twin primes converges. The general number  eld one of these is able to identify smaller smooth numbers and is therefore more e cient. Sundaram and Atkin each name one of these things which is used to  nd   prime numbers, and the quadratic one of these is the fastest factorization algorithm for small integers. For ten points, identify these number theory constructs, the most famous of which identi es prime numbers and is named for Eratosthenes.

TOSSUP: This result fails for odd-dimensional surfaces because the alternating sum of their Betti numbers is zero instead of two. As a result of this non-eponymous theorem, any continuous mapping from the surface of a sphere to itself must either have a    xed point or a point that maps to its antipode. This theo- rem implies that some point on the Earth has zero wind velocity, and has been summarized as  you can't comb a coconut . For ten points, identify this re- sult stating that every continuous vector  eld on an even-dimensional spherical surface must have at least one point where the vector is zero.

TOSSUP: The number of this kind of degree-n polynomials mod 2 is equal to the number of binary Lyndon words with length n. Any representation of a  nite Lie group can be expressed as a direct sum of this kind of representations, and the number of this kind of representations of a group is equal to the number of conjugacy classes of the group. This term is used to describe ring ideals not expressible as the   intersection of two other ideals. x2 + 1 is this over the integers, but is not this mod 2 because it is the product of x + 1 with itself. For ten points, identify this term used to describe polynomials that cannot be factored.

TOSSUP: These things are generalized by CW-complexes. The Kuratowski reduction theorem states that any of these things with a certain property must have one of two speci c ones of these things as a minor. They're not matrices, but these things have spectra consisting of the set of their eigenvalues. Products on these things include the strong, categorical, and lexicographic products. If these things are disconnected, then they have in nite   diameter. One of these things is called a tournament if it is complete and oriented. The bipartite type of these things is de ned by having a chromatic number of two. For ten points, identify these mathematical objects consisting of a set of points connected by edges.

TOSSUP: This quantity is equal to the double integralG are the coe cients of the  rst fundamental form. This quantity is equal to the integral of the norm of Tu cross Tv. The value of this quantity for a zoneis equal to 2πrh, and for an oblate   spheroid it is 2πa + e ln 1−e . This quantity is notably in nite for the shape created by revolving the curve y = 1 about the y-axis; that shape is known as Gabriel's Horn. This quantity is the derivative of volume with respect to the inradius of many symmetric shapes. For ten points, identify this property of a three-dimensional shape, which for cubes is equal to 6 times the edge length squared.

TOSSUP: Picard groups are groups of equivalence classes of fractional ideals with this property. If T is a linear operator on a Hilbert space, then the spectrum of T is the set of λ such that T − λI does not have this property on all of the Hilbert space. Maps with this property comprise the elements of the holonomy group of a Riemann manifold, and a square matrix has this property if it has as many   pivot positions as columns or rows. A knot is said to have this property if it can be transformed into a copy of itself with the orientation reversed. For ten points, identify this property, which is possessed by any matrix which is row-equivalent to the identity matrix and whose eigenvalues are nonzero.

TOSSUP: One approximate method for doing this is found in the Sulba Sutras. This action was mentioned in The Birds by Aristophanes, and Hippocrates attempted to  nd a way to do this by using lunes. The philosopher Thomas Hobbes believed himself to be capable of doing this, leading to a lengthy debate with John Wallis. The Indiana   Pi Bill notably contained a proposed method of doing this. This action's impossibility was a corollary of the Lindemann-Weierstrass theorem. For ten points, identify this ancient problem involving the construction of a certain shape with area pi.

TOSSUP: This function satis es the equation that this function of s is equal to 2s Â·πs−1 Â· sin   πs   Â· Γ(1 − s)Â·THIS(1 − s). This function of 3 is equal to Apery's 2constant, and it has a closed-form expression for even integers in terms of the Bernoulli numbers. The   Basel problem asked for the value of this functionπ2 1of 2; that value is 6 . This function of zero is equal to −2, and this functionof −1 is equal to − 1 . An important unsolved problem in math asks whether 12the zeros of this function all lie on the critical line. For ten points, identify this function, which at s is equal to the analytic continuation of the sum of 1 forall positive integers n.

TOSSUP: Babich showed that scrawny examples of these objects could not be de ned by tori in a 1992 paper. Any of these sets is, up to homeomorphism, the only totally disconnected perfect compact metric space. One example of these sets also named for Smith and Volterra has positive Lebesgue measure. The most commonly known example of these sets is also known as the ternary set and has fractal dimension less than   one, and consists of all the real numbers between zero and one whose ternary expansion never contains the digit 1. For ten points, identify this group of nowhere dense perfect sets, one example of which was constructed by iteratively removing the middle third of an interval.

TOSSUP: The distributive inequalities and the modular identity are true for all of these objects, and these objects are called bounded if their bottom and top are both identities. Heyting and Boolean algebras are special cases of these algebraic objects, an example of which is the set of all partitions of a set with respect to re nement. These structures can be used to represent   partially ordered sets, and the operations de ned on these structures must obey the absorption law and be commutative, associative, and idempotent. For ten points, identify these algebraic structures with operations meet and join, which share a name with a mesh or grid of points.

TOSSUP: Modules are like vector spaces except that their coe cients are taken from these and not  elds. These entities are called Artinian if they ful ll the de- scending   chain condition, and the octonions form a non-associative one of these entities. A commutative one of these entities with a unit element and no divisors of zero is called an integral domain. These entities are referred to as simple if their only two-sided ideals are themselves and zero. Unlike groups, these objects have two binary operations, only one of which requires an identity or inverses. For ten points, identify these algebraic structures with an additive and multiplicative operation, examples of which include the one of integers.

TOSSUP: A vector  eld on a manifold M is called nice if it has one of these C such that the intersection of C with any leaf in the interior of M is a singleton. The elements of these objects correspond to the cosets of isotropy subgroups. For the orthogonal group of signature (1, 1), these are the origin, the four axes, and the hyperbolas de ned by xy = k. An action is called a   stabilizer for x if this object for x has only one element under that action. For ten points, identify this concept from group theory which for an element x of a set consists of the set of gx for all g in the group acting on that set, described by a term which also describes the path taken by a satellite.

TOSSUP: Golomb constructed a combinatorial proof of this result which used the count- ing of necklaces. The converse of this result is false, but it is strengthened by Lehmer's theorem, which is true. This result generalizes the Chinese hypothesis and is itself a generalization of Euler's totient theorem.   Carmichael numbers are counterexamples to the converse of this result for all bases, and numbers which are counterexamples to its converse for some base are called pseudoprimes. For ten points, identify this result stating that for a natural number a and a prime number p, then ap is congruent to a mod p; it is contrasted with its namesake's  last  theorem.

TOSSUP: Every metric space with this property is a Baire space by the Baire category theorem, and the Banach  xed point theorem ensures that a contraction map- ping on a metric space with this property admits a  xed point. A metric space has this property if and only if every possibly in nite set of nested closed subsets has a nonempty intersection. The space of p-adic numbers has this property for any prime p. A metric space is considered to have this property if every   Cauchy sequence in that metric space converges. For ten points, identify this property held by the real numbers because there are no gaps in the number line.

TOSSUP: The narrator describes one location in this work by declaring  Neighbors remained neighbors till death did them part . The presence of Fog, which causes far-away objects to appear dimmer, is central to the art of Sight Recognition in this work. One con ict in this work between Pantocyclus and Chromatistes leads to the passage of the Universal   Colour Bill. The protagonist of this work uses the phrase  Upward, not Northward  to attempt to convince his compatriots of the existence of a third dimension. For ten points, identify this satire of Victorian society by Edwin Abbott Abbott, which features the protagonist, A Square, who lives in the title two-dimensional world.

TOSSUP: Description acceptable. The proof of this result begins by stating First, let π be some k-cycle on [n] . Ken Keeler, who originated this result, stated in a DVD commentary that he didn't feel it was of su cient importance to be considered a theorem . This result's proof is reliant on the fact that any permutation can be expressed as a sum of disjoint cycles, because the device to which it pertains cannot perform the same switch twice. This result was proved by Ethan Tate and Clyde Dixon of the Harlem Globetrotters, who then successfully applied it to save characters like the Professor and Leela. Appearing in the episode The Prisoner of Benda , for ten points, identify this result which guarantees that people can always be restored to their bodies with the aid of two outside parties. 

TOSSUP: A 1968 paper by Chorin presents a nite-di erence method for numerically approximating a solution to these things. A book titled after these things by Roger Temam includes an appendix about the curl operator and chapters about their steady-state and evolution type. These things are distinguished from the Euler equations because they account for situations which are not inviscid. One of the Millenium problems asks whether a smooth solution exists to the three-dimensional version of these equations. For ten points, identify these doubly-eponymous di erential equations which describe the motion of uids with nonzero viscosity. 

TOSSUP: Description acceptable. This object is the basis of a branch of projective geometry designed to give apartments and buildings equal standing. Durov constructed this object as a commutative algebraic monad, and Borger used descent to construct it from nite elds. Pointed sets are vector spaces over this object, and Weyl groups are simple algebraic groups over it.

TOSSUP: Dini's theorem says that if something has a weak form of this property and ful- lls other conditions, then it also has a stronger form of this property. Bertrand ￼ ￼ ￼ ￼ ￼ ￼ ￼ ￼ ￼ and Dirichlet both name conditions to determine whether something has this property. Hadamard's theorem gives a means for determining this quantity's namesake radius. If a series has the conditional variety of this property, then its sum can be changed by rearranging its values. The harmonic series notably does not have this property, although if one removes all the numbers which have the digit nine somewhere in the denominator, the resulting series does. For ten points, identify this property held by a series or sequence whose limit at in nity exists.

TOSSUP: One condition for a submersion to be smooth is that the di erential have this property. One property required of gerbes is that there must be a local homeomorphism with this property whose accompanying category is non-empty. If a certain embedding from a normed space to its second dual vector space has this property, then that space is re exive; the embedding in question is the canonical map. There exists a map with this property from any   covering space to the space it covers. A map with this property is called an epimorphism. The term onto is used to describe, for ten points, what sort of functions which map to the entire range?

TOSSUP: This non-Weil mathematician names a conjecture that was proved in 1973 by Pierre Deligne, who won a Fields Medal for that work. This mathematician co-developed a series which can be used to exactly compute the number of   partitions of an integer.

A paper by Daniel Helkey uses a modeling ap- proach to determine how luggage a ects this process, and a 2013 article in the Economist discusses the bene ts of the Flying Carpet method for doing this. Organizations like   Frontier utilize the back-to-front method of doing this, while Southwest notably does not pre-assign seat locations. For ten points, identify this process which precedes an airline  ight and which usually takes place on jetbridges.

TOSSUP: A closed one of these is called essential if it has nonzero intersection with every other nonzero closed one of these things. If these things are maximal, then they are prime, meaning the set of elements not in them is closed un- der multiplication. Operations on these include   contraction and expansion, which consist of putting them through a homomorphism or through its inverse, respectively. One of these things is called principal if it is generated by a single element. For ten points, identify these subsets of rings which consist of additive groups closed under multiplication.

TOSSUP: A suspension is de ned by the join of one of these with a pair of points. If one of these has a property named for Baire, then each of its subsets of the  rst category must have an empty interior. These things were de ned by Hausdor  using several axioms which are no longer considered necessary, such as the requirement that any two elements of these things be elements of   disjoint open sets; that is the criterion for these things to be Hausdor . These things must be closed under arbitrary union and  nite intersection. For ten points, identify these mathematical objects which de ne a collection of open sets.

TOSSUP: If a polynomial equation Q has a root for this operation applied to the equation Q with respect to a prime p, then there will exist a unique root for Q for this operation applied to a power of p by Hensel's lifting lemma. An odd prime p is expressible as the sum of two squares if and only if a form of this operation applied to p yields one according to one of many results called Fermat's Theorem. For two numbers a and p, a raised to p minus 1 divided by two applied to this operation of p gives the (*) Legendre symbol, giving conditions for when the golden theorem can be satisfied.

TOSSUP: Matroids named after this man have a rank that, when incremented by one, is divisible by the cardinality of the underlying set. Hierholzer's algorithm and Fleury's algorithm compute structures  named for this scientist. The number of those structures named for this scientist is given by the following formula: the number of arborescences times the product of "the degree of each vertex in the graph minus one" factorial. That formula, is the subject of the so-called (*) BEST theorem and gives the number of unicursal trails named for this scientist. This mathematician proved that an even number of vertices will have an odd degree in all undirected graphs.

TOSSUP: Applying this operation to the j-function led Conway and Norton to realize that certain numbers in the j function were one bigger than the number of dimensions of non-trivial representations of the group M; that realization became known as the monstrous moonshine conjecture. In the context of modular forms, this function uniquely determines the modular form of functions and is sometimes named after the letter q. The integral of the square of a function f is equal to the infinite sum of the values generated by applying this function to f by Parseval's Identity. This operation applied to a function f will equal the original function if the function is (*) absolutely-integrable and contains a finite number of discontinuities as part of the Dirichlet conditions. Performing this operation on some functions, such as the square wave, leads to an undesirable "overshooting" known as the Gibbs phenomenon. For 10 points, name this operation that expresses a function as a sum of trigonometric functions.

TOSSUP: One of these functions named after Niels Abel appears in the solution of a problem that asks for the curve in the vertical plane that starts at a given point and intersects the tau axis. There is an orthonormal set of eigenfunctions and eigenvalues that sums to one of these functions according to Mercer's Theorem. According to a theorem in functional analysis, one of two examples of these functions has a nontrivial solution for every fixed, non-zero complex eigenvalue if a certain symmetric function is integer-valued. In the Fredholm type of these equations, their associated (*) kernel is compact. Boundaries are set to unknown values in the Volterra type of these functions, which are often used to model radiosity and scattering problems since values of interest need to be calculated over a solid angle. For 10 points, name these equations in which variables of interest are expressed as a function of antiderivatives.

TOSSUP: Sevast'yanov showed that an approximate answer of "1.2 times the square root of c over 2k plus one" resolves the "almost" variant of this problem. Schemes named after this problem work by storing values and their associated inverse images, and then checking to see if any of the stored values are the same; such schemes become impractical when n, or the number of stored values, is greater than 160, though those schemes named after this problem are still used to (*) brute-force cryptographic hashes. The generalized form of this problem was modeled using multinomial theory by Levin. In Martin Gardner's original formulation of this problem, for n = 30, the solution to this problem is approximately 70%. By the pigeonhole principle, the solution to this problem is 100% when n = 366 or more. For 10 points, name this problem from combinatorics that asks for the probability that at least 2 people in a group are born during the same day.

TOSSUP: If the set X is a particular point topological set, then it will possess the "pseudo-" form of this property, meaning that the set's image under any continuous function to the reals is bounded. However, set X will lack the "meta-" form of this property, whose definition involves a point finite refinement. Applying an ultrafilter to a topological set with this property will always yield one point. A totally disconnected T2 space with this property will be isomorphic to a Boolean algebra according to (*) Stone's Representation theorem. For a weak topology, the Eberlein-Schmulian theorem states that three different forms of this property are equivalent in a Banach space. The "weakly countably" form of this property holds for a set X if every subset of X has a limit point; another definition of this property is that every open cover of the set has a finite subcover. For 10 points, name this property of a Euclidean topological space making it both closed and bounded.

TOSSUP: This operation, applied to the quantity "negative 1 to the fermion number times the negative exponential of beta H," generates a function which is equal to zero if supersymmetry is spontaneously broken, the Witten Index.

TOSSUP: One system modeled using this distribution considers a container which initially contains a finite number of balls of different colors, and after each successive draw, an additional ball of the drawn color is placed in the container. This statistical distribution is used for the prior topic distribution in a commonly used special case of probabilistic latent semantic analysis introduced by Blei et al; that is its namesake "latent allocation". An infinite dimensional version of this distribution is used to model a process in which a new customer either sits next to a person already at a table or at a new table, called the (*) Chinese Restaurant Process. The multivariate beta function is used as the normalizing parameter of this distribution, whose symmetric version is commonly used as a prior in hierarchical Bayesian modelling. For 10 points, name this statistical distribution, the conjugate prior of the multinomial distribution, named for a French mathematician who also lends his name to the pigeonhole principle.

TOSSUP: NOTE: The correct answer to the is tossup is a formula; we're looking for something like "n-squared plus 1". Granville and Ramare proved Erdős' conjecture that this function of n is never squarefree for n greater than four. A graph with this many vertices whose edges are two-colored will necessarily have a monochromatic clique of size n plus one. The maximum size of Sperner family of sets over 2n elements is this function of n. Numbers of this form have generating function one over the square root of quantity one minus four times x. Asymptotically, this function of n approaches four-to-the-n divided by the square root of quantity pi times n. This function of n divided by the quantity n plus one yields the nth (*) Catalan number. The sum from k equals zero to n of the squares of binomial coefficients of the form n choose k is equal to to this function of n. Numbers of this form appear in the center of the even rows of Pascal's triangle. For 10 points, how many ways are there to select n people, regardless of gender, from a group of n boys and n girls?

TOSSUP: A finite group G is generated through the pseudo form of this operation if and only if the ring of invariants of G acting on a finite-dimensional vector space form a polynomial ring. For an n-dimensional symmetric bilinear space over a field with characteristic not equal to two, every element of its orthogonal group is a composition of at most n of these operations. For a nonzero vector v in a vector space, a transformation describing this operation applied to x is equal to x minus quantity two times inner product of x and v divided by inner product of v with itself, all times v. That transformation is the (*) Householder transformation. For the dihedral group D sub n, if n is even, the set of these fall into two conjugacy classes. Matrices describing this operation are orthogonal and have determinant equal to negative one. The composition of an even number of instances of this operation yields a rotation. For 10 points, name this operation which creates mirror images.

TOSSUP: If one of these structures is GF-four representable, then all GF-four representations of these objects are equivalent. R-sub-ten is a unique splitter for a certain class of these structures according to Seymour. One of these structures of rank r is uniform if and only if all of its circuits have exactly r plus one elements. The regular types of these structures can be represented over all fields and are precisely those that don't contain the four-point line, the Fano plane, and its dual. The Tutte polynomial of these structures is a generalization of the (*) characteristic polynomial to two variables. Maximal independent ones of these are bases.

Those matrices can be used to construct diagrams co-named for this man and Dynkin which can be used to visualize his namesake groups. The relations in his namesake groups set products of two of the generators r sub i and r sub j raised to the m sub i comma j power equal to one and are used to describe (*) kaleidoscopic objects. This author's work with geometry served as a major inspiration for the works of Buckminster Fuller and M.C. Escher.

TOSSUP: Three of these figures meet at each edge of the 120-cell, which consists of a total of 120 of these figures. The PoincarÃ© homology sphere and the Weber-Seifert space are constructed by applying two different amounts of twisting, and then gluing opposite portions of this figure. The SchlÃ¤fli symbol {5,3} corresponds to this figure. Three of the four objects named for Kepler and Poinsot are named for and derived from this figure, including the small and great stellated variants of it. It is possible to find a path that visits each of this figure's vertices precisely once and then ends back at the starting point, (*) a task that is the goal set by William Hamilton in the icosian game. For a prescribed volume, this figure has the smallest edge length of any regular, convex polyhedron. For 10 points, name this Platonic solid with 30 edges, which is the dual of the icosahedron, has faces that are regular pentagons, and has 12 faces.

TOSSUP: A mapping of this type that preserves hyperbolic distances preserves all distances according to the Schwarz-Pick lemma, which was used as the basis for a proof using the Caratheodory metric of the Earle-Hamilton fixed-point theorem applying to mappings with this property. Runge's theorem places a bound on the poles of rational functions that converge to functions with this property. A simple test for whether a function has this property is offered by Morera's theorem. Functions with this property can be represented as a product from which one can read off their zeros (*) according to the Weierstrass factorization theorem. The ranges of values assumed by functions with this property are described by the "little" and "great" theorems named for Picard. A bounded function with this property must be constant according to Liouville's theorem. A function that has this property over the whole complex plane is called "entire." For 10 points, name this property from complex analysis in which a function is complex differentiable at every point in its domain.

TOSSUP: A module over R has this property if and only if every module homomorphism from an ideal of R to the module can be extended to a homomorphism from R to the module according to Baer's criterion. Â The Ext functor of M and N can be computed by taking this type of resolution of N and then finding the Hom of the resolution and taking the homology of that complex, and this type of module can be defined by dualizing the commutative diagram that defines a projective module. If a mapping into a space has a differential with this property, then that mapping is an immersion. (*) In a short exact sequence, A goes to B goes to C, the mapping on the left must have this property. This property is often checked by starting with f of a equals f of b and showing that in that case, a must equal b. The horizontal line test checks for this property and a bijection must be surjective and have this property. For ten points, name this property of mappings which means that each element of the domain is mapped to a unique element in the codomain.

TOSSUP: This adjective describes a class of functorial field theories in which the correlation functions are metric-independent. Those theories are broadly divided into "Witten-type" and "Schwarz-type", and an example of the latter is the theory of Chern and Simons. A type of computing described by this adjective braids and fuses certain non-abelian quasiparticles; the Fibonacci model exemplifies that type of computing. One class of quantum error-correcting codes described by this adjective permits the characterization of stabilizer violations as anyons; Kitaev's toric code is one example. This adjective describes a property held by systems that are robust against all local perturbations; (*) that property is this kind of "order".

TOSSUP: A sweep-line algorithm that accomplishes this process via a divide-and-conquer strategy with a computational complexity of O(n log n) was developed by Garey. Tarjan and van Wyk reduced this complexity to O(n log log n) by reducing the problem of performing this process to the problem of computing the horizontal visibility map. Fisk used this process, followed by a 3-coloring, to give a short proof of Chvatal's art gallery theorem. Chazelle demonstrated a linear time method for performing this operation (*) on a simple polygon , and a method for carrying out this process such that the result satisfies the empty circumcircle property was developed by Delaunay. For a simple and convex polygon, this can be trivially performed by picking a vertex and drawing a line to every other vertex not adjacent to the chosen one. For 10 points, identify this procedure of subdividing a surface into 2-simplexes whose angles sum to 180 degrees.

TOSSUP: A result by Cvitanic and Karatzas used convex analysis to generalize this result to families of functions. A 1951 paper by Dantzig and Wald answered two questions left open by the paper that derived this result by demonstrating both an existence proof as well as a necessity and sufficiency proof. This result can be visualized by depicting it as an optimal receiver operating characteristic curve. In signal detection (*) theory, this statement is equivalent to the maximization of the true positive rate for some upper bound on the false negative rate. This statement was first introduced by its namesakes in the paper "On the Problem of the Most Efficient Tests of Statistical Hypotheses."

TOSSUP: Beppo Levi's theorem establishes the value of this operation on the pointwise limit of a pointwise monotonic sequence of functions. This operation's value for the limit inferior of a sequence of functions is less than or equal to the lim-inf of its values for those functions according to Fatou's lemma.  This operation's namesake showed how the existence of a larger function establishes its value for a smaller function in his (*) dominated convergence theorem. The space of functions to which this operation may be applied is a Banach space, in which continuous compactly-supported functions form a dense subset. This operation, which may be applied to functions in the Lp spaces, gives equal values for functions that differ only on a set of measure zero. It recapitulates the results of another method that approximates the area under a curve using rectangles. For 10 points, name this operation that extends the Riemann integral to measure spaces.

TOSSUP: A theorem extending this statement concerns the impossibility of embedding a set of non-commuting observables in a commutative algebraic structure; that extension is the Kochen-Specker theorem. In a quip reminiscent of Wolfgang Pauli, this statement's formulator declared a similar but faulty theorem by John von Neumann to be "not merely false but foolish" due to its unphysical assumptions. Aspect, Grangier, and Roger verified the predictions of this statement using two-photon atomic transitions from calcium cascade decay. The bounds that this statement places on the results of a two-channel (*) detector experiment are equivalent to the later-developed CHSH inequality. This theorem, which was introduced in the paper "On the Einstein Podolsky Rosen Paradox," is usually explained in terms of correlations between simultaneous measurements of entangled particles.

This man names a lemma stating that the product of two primitive polynomials is primitive, as well as the aforementioned theorem co-named with (*) Bonnet. This man was the first to use three horizontal lines to indicate congruence between numbers. He was also the first to prove a theorem that sets the Legendre symbol "p on q" times "q on p" equal to a complicated power of negative one, which concerns solvability of congruences of primes. As a child, this prover of the law of quadratic reciprocity apocryphally summed the numbers 1 to 100 very quickly. For 10 points, name this German mathematician who gives his name to the normal distribution.

In neutron scattering, the dynamic structure factor results from performing it on the two-point correlation function. For a real-valued input, this operation's output function is Hermitian, while for an input that is real and even, the output is also real. The integral of this operation's output squared equals the integral of the original function squared according to (*) Plancherel's theorem, which establishes this operation's unitarity. Applying this operation to a complex exponential gives a shifted delta function, and vice versa, while applying it to a Gaussian gives back another Gaussian. This operation integrates a time-dependent function against the exponential of "negative i omega t." For 10 points, name this mathematical operation that changes a time-domain signal into a frequency-domain signal.

TOSSUP: The Breusch-Pagan test determines whether this quantity is constant across observations. Peter Whittle derived an extension of one bound on this quantity that applies to wide-sense stationary time series. That result bounds this quantity below by the negative reciprocal of the expected second derivative of the log-likelihood. This quantity is greater than or equal to the reciprocal of the Fisher information according to the (*) Cramer-Rao bound. This quantity, which is given by the second cumulant, is the same across repeated samples if a variable is homoscedastic. This quantity equals the mean of the square minus the square of the mean.

For M that is m by n, this process can be performed by [read slowly] finding Σ["sigma"], whose diagonal entries are the (*) singular values of M, then finding m by m U and n by n V* ["v-star"],which are both unitary; M then equals U times Σ times V*. For 10 points, name this process in which a matrix isexpressed as a product of other matrices.

TOSSUP: Broyden's method belongs to a family of methods that are like this one, but use an approximate Hessian orJacobian. This method precedes Halley's method as the first of Householder's methods, and shows (*)quadratic convergence for close starting points. In this method, each iterate is produced by subtracting from theprevious iterate the quotient of the function and its derivative, both evaluated at that iterate. For 10 points, name thismethod that uses the x-intercepts of tangent lines to approximate the roots of a function.

For 10 points, give this word describing systems of equations with no constantterms.

TOSSUP: Charles Blair demonstrated that this theorem implies the axiom of dependent choice, a weaker version of theaxiom of choice. A typical proof of this theorem constructs a nested sequence of open balls disjoint from asequence of nowhere dense sets and uses the nested interval theorem to show the balls have a non-emptyintersection. This theorem states that the countable intersection of open, (*) dense subsets of a complete metricspace, X, is dense, from which it follows that X is not a countable union of nowhere dense sets. This theorem is offundamental importance because it can be used to prove the closed graph theorem, uniform boundednessprinciple, and open mapping theorem. For 10 points, name this "category theorem" fundamental to functionalanalysis.

These two properties can be shown by combining Osgood's condition and Peano's theorem. Thecontraction mapping principle can be used to prove the (*) Picard-LindelÃ¶f theorem about these two properties.These two properties are part of Hadamard's three requirements for well-posedness. If a function f of x comma ysatisfies the uniform Lipschitz condition in a given rectangle, then the IVP "y-prime equals f of x comma y" hasthese two properties. For 10 points, name these two properties that guarantee a differential equation has a solutionand that it's the only solution.

TOSSUP: This mathematician's thesis "On Denumerability in Topology" contains his namesake lemma: every nonemptycollection of finite character has a maximal set with respect to inclusion. This mathematician built onQuenouille's ("qwen-wheeze") jackknifing method while championing exploratory data analysis, which heliterally wrote the textbook on in 1977. A test for pairwise a posteriori multiple comparisons named for thismathematician computes an (*) "honest significant difference", or HSD, variable, and is a common post hoc testused with ANOVA. You can thank this mathematician for inventing the box-and-whisker plot. For 10 points, namethis mathematician that popularized the fast Fourier transform after publishing an algorithm with James Cooley.

TOSSUP: These things are equivalent to the homomorphism of a module defined over a field, rather than a ring. Becausethese functions preserve the origin, they are subset of affine functions where the translation is zero. The space ofall of these things whose codomain is a scalar field defines the dual space of their domain. These things are (*)invertible, being both surjective and injective, if their domain and codomain have the same dimension. Thedimension of an input vector space is equal to the sums of the dimensions of the kernel and range of these things.For 10 points, name these additive and homogeneous functions that are defined between two vector spaces.

TOSSUP: Aryabhatta's kuttaka method for performing this operation literally means "pulverizer." For a congruence classa modulo m, all x in a have the same value for this operation as a. Any r in a reduced residue system modulo aninteger n has a value of one for this operation. According to BÃ©zout's identity, for integers m and n, this operationyields the smallest positive number of the form a m plus b n, a and b being integers. The Chinese remaindertheorem can be used to show that when this operation returns one for integers m and n, then (*) phi of m n equalphi m phi n. The Euler totient function of an integer n returns the number of integers less than n for which thisoperation returns one. An elementary way to perform this operation by hand is the Euclidean algorithm. For 10points, name this operation that, for two integers, gives the largest integer that divides both integers. 

TOSSUP: These things are equivalent to the homomorphism of a module defined over a field, rather than a ring. Becausethese functions preserve the origin, they are subset of affine functions where the translation is zero. The space ofall of these things whose codomain is a scalar field defines the dual space of their domain. These things are (*)invertible, being both surjective and injective, if their domain and codomain have the same dimension. Thedimension of an input vector space is equal to the sums of the dimensions of the kernel and range of these things.For 10 points, name these additive and homogeneous functions that are defined between two vector spaces.

TOSSUP:  If a smooth example of these things is of the class C super r, meaning r times continuously differentiable, thena diffeomorphism from the class C super r can be used to rectify it. A tangent example of these things is a sectionof the tangent bundle of a differentiable manifold. A line tangent to one of these things at every point is anintegral curve. If these things satisfy the conditions of Helmholtz's theorem, they can be written as the sum of an(*) irrotational and a solenoidal component, using the gradient and curl operators. Their line integral along a curveis equal to the dot product of these things evaluated along the curve and the differential of the parametrized curve.For 10 points, name these constructs that assign a direction and magnitude to every point in a space. 

TOSSUP: This work's method was partially explained in its author's treatise Data. It's not by Plato, but anextremely influential commentary on Book 1 of this treatise was written by Proclus, who claims that it reliesheavily on Eudoxus. A massive translation and compilation of commentary on this book was produced byT.L. Heath. It's not by Aristotle, but this treatise is the classic approximation of the method described in thePosterior Analytics. This book puts forth five "common notions" that are close to the modern definition ofan (*) equivalence relation. Much of book ten of this treatise may be based on the work of Theaetetus. This textbegins at the limit of intelligibility by defining that which "has no part," and then explores further "limits" withthings like "breadthless length." It is notoriously impossible to use the first axioms of this book to prove itsparallel postulate. For 10 points, name this foundational work of Greek geometry, which is attributed to Euclid.

TOSSUP: Amir Aczel wrote a book claiming that this writer was a key influence on Claude Lévi-Strauss and structuralism in general. The second volume of this writer's most famous book derived much of its presentation from Bartel van der Waerden. The first volume of that work by this author begins by grounding all theories in terms of relations of assemblies of signs, and ends with a category-theory-like description of mappings between general "structures." This writer influenced writers like Serge Lang by taking Hilbert's axiomatic method to extremes, and operating at the absolute highest level of (*) abstraction possible, which makes his books almost impossible to read. For 10 points, name this twentieth-century French mathematician, who was very heavily influenced by the ideas of André Weil and Jean Dieudonné, since he was actually a collective pseudonym.

TOSSUP: This theory led to the formulation of mathematical "topoi," which behave like sheaves and give rise to a semantics of modal logic usually named for André Joyal and Saul Kripke. In this theory, a result that closely resembles Cayley's Theorem from group theory, fully describes the transformations on a "representable" class of objects, and is named for Yoneda. This theory was studied in terms of a hyphenated "onto-logy" and the concept of "being-there" in a book about the "Transcendental" by Alain (*) Badiou. This theory encodes the idea of "efficiency" in the universal properties of free objects, which usually involve a triangular diagram in which their natural transformations commute. This theory gave rise to the computer science terms "covariant" and "contravariant." Saunders Mac Lane introduced this theory's language of morphisms, arrows, and functors. For 10 points, name this generalization of much of algebra and set theory, so general that it was attacked as "abstract nonsense.

TOSSUP: The rapidly random exploring tree algorithm is a Monte Carlo method that favors sampling the larger components of these structures. Bounding volumes combined with a Ã¢Â€ÂœmarchingÃ¢Â€Â algorithm named for these constructs is used to implement proximity queries in some collision-detection algorithms. These constructs may be used to approximate a surfaceÃ¢Â€Â™s medial axis, of which they can be considered a discrete analogue. Duals to these constructs can be generated by the trivial Ã¢Â€Âœedge flipÃ¢Â€Â algorithm. One of these constructs can be created by successive recomputation of centroids as part of LloydÃ¢Â€Â™s algorithm. Non-convex polygons comprise one of these constructs when Manhattan distance is used as the norm, but in Euclidean space, these geometric constructs are constructed entirely of convex shapes and are the duals to Delaunay triangulations. For 10 points, name these eponymous diagrams that, given a set of seed points in a space, construct a tessellation by identifying the closest seed point for each point in the space. 

TOSSUP: This result can be proven by considering it as a corollary of Fagin's theorem, which states that all properties of second order logic are tractably verifiable using a first-order formula. A reduction named for this result is used to prove the Valiant-Vazirani theorem, which further refines this statement. Using this result to prove the Karp-Lipton theorem shows that "AM equals MA" in the context of the Arthur- Merlin protocol. Proving this statement involves examining legal sets of windows in a tableau to show that there exists a polynomial time sequence of configurations that includes a language's accept state. This statement implies that it is difficult to efficiently convert from conjunctive normal form to disjunctive normal form. As a result of this lemma, the clique and the knapsack problems are intractable, since those problems can be reduced to the problem for which this theorem applies. For 10 points, name this theorem stating that the Boolean satisfiability problem is NP-complete. 

TOSSUP: The variables in this mathematical approach can be turned into quantifiable outputs using "center of gravity" and "center of area" approaches, or they can be combined into a centroid approach. Both Godel and Mamdini modified the implication operator can so that it is polyvalent in this approach. This approach, which is often used to control and model anti-lock brakes, uses IF-THEN syntax instead of IF- ELSE syntax. The inputs to this approach are called linguistic variables and actually have real world meaning. Lofti Zadeh introduced the notation for this representation, in which elements of a set are assigned a value that represents their degree of inclusiveness. This infinite-valued system is used when the principle of bivalence and the law of the excluded middle do not necessarily hold. For 10 points, name this system of logic that expresses a notion of vagueness by having statements take on a value between zero and one to represent "sort of true, sort of false." 

TOSSUP: One theorem co-named for this mathematician is proven by using Schwarz's lemma to map a half-plane to a disk, and that technique is ultimately used to show when an analytic function is bounded by the real part. This man's namesake hierarchy orders the sets of finite and infinite rank that are generated from intersecting Polish spaces. Those sets, which are also named for him, define the associated sigma algebra of a topological space. This co-namesake of a theorem with Constantin Caratheodory also names a theorem stating that, if the sum of a series of events is finite in a probability space, then the probability that an infinite sequence of said events occurs is zero; that theorem is co-named for this man and Francesco Cantelli. This man is the second namesake of a theorem that states that, for a subspace of a Euclidean space, every open cover has a finite subcover. For 10 points, name this mathematician who names that theorem with Eduard Heine.

TOSSUP: Zhong et al. used this mathematical procedure as part of an algorithm to create digital watermarks. This procedure is applied to the covariance matrix to find the rotation matrix that minimizes the root mean square deviation in the Kabsch algorithm. Most methods of performing this procedure begin with a Householder reduction of the input so that the input is bidiagonalized; such methods include the Golub- Kahan algorithm. This operation is often visualized as a procedure that rotates, scales, and re-rotates a coordinate axis, leaving the system sheared. This procedure is used to compress an image by repartitioning the RGB values in matrices into a rank-R truncation of the terms this operation produces. This operation is used to quickly compute the pseudoinverse, and it is a generalization of the spectral factorization for rectangular matrices. For 10 points, name this operation that factors a matrix into three other matrices, the second of which contains the namesake numbers on its diagonal.

TOSSUP: In 1981, Takeda et. al devised a method for fringe-pattern analysis that used this operation to detectsmall phase variations. Performing this operation on a Dirac comb returns itself. Applying this operation toa function that is in L1 and L2 will necessarily result in a product in L2 by Plancherel's theorem. Thisoperation is unitary by Parseval's relation. Performing this operation on any constant function yields theDirac delta function, while performing this operation on an image can decompose it into a sum of sines andcosines. Cooley and Tukey developed an algorithm for implementing its "fast" variety. For 10 points, namethis transformation that takes an input in the time domain and maps it to the frequency domain.

TOSSUP: Modification of a theorem named for this man with ordinal indices can be used to prove the Erdos-Radotheorem. Schanuel's conjecture leads to a result co-named for this man stating that a set of independentalgebraic integers will also have independent exponentials. Another theorem named for this man and anItalian describes the density of analytic functions near essential singularities in a complex space. Thosetheorems are co-named for Lindemann and Casorati. This mathematician developed the M-test for uniformconvergence. He states that every continuous function can be modeled arbitrarily closely by a polynomial, aresult improved upon by Marshall Stone. For 10 points, name this German mathematician whose namesakefunction is continuous everywhere but differentiable nowhere.

TOSSUP: The nilpotence of one of these structures is related to the nilpotence of other operators on a vector spaceby Engel's theorem. Assigning one of these to a Lie group defines a functor. One of these is solvable if itsKilling form vanishes on its derived form by Cartan's first criteria. The exponential function can be used togenerate a Lie group from one of these. These entities can be studied using Dynkin diagrams. Thesestructures are skewsymmetric, bilinear and satisfy the Jacobi identity. A special class of these is named forKac and Moody. For 10 points, name this type of vector space, named for a Norwegian.

TOSSUP: Jucys-Murphy elements are used to study this group's representations, which include Specht modules.Jordan's Theorem states that if a primitive subgroup of this group has a cycle of prime length, it is eitherthis group or a specific subgroup of it. The Robinson-Schensted correspondence bijects the elements of thisgroup with Young tableaux, which George Frobenius applied to the study of this group. Any group G isisomorphic to a subgroup of this group acting on G according to Cayley's Theorem. A subgroup of thisgroup comprising only the even elements is called the alternating group, and when this group acts on a setof n elements, it has cardinality n factorial. For 10 points, name this group comprising all the permutationsof a set of elements under composition.

TOSSUP: In PET studies testing blood flow to the human brain, Worsley et. al used this value as an estimator forthe number of activated regions. This quantity can be determined in the situation where one surface iscovering another by using a ramification index. Another theorem for determining this quantity can beproven by showing that the degree of a vector field equals its Lefschetz number. That theorem sets it equalto the sum of the indices over the zeroes of a vector space. Those are the Riemann-Hurwitz formula and thePoincare-Hopf index theorem. This quantity is equal to two minus twice the genus and it equals minus twofor a double torus. For 10 points, name this quantity from topology which, for a polyhedron, equalsverticies plus faces minus edges.

TOSSUP: An application of a lattice basis reduction theorem resulted in the first efficient algorithm for doing this task and was invented by Lenstra, Lenstra, and Lovasz. Algorithms that do this task can be repurposed to compute discrete logs; one of those algorithms that works for Galois fields is the popular Cantor-Zassenhaus algorithm, which replaced the similar Berlekamp algorithm. This procedure can be done on “square-free” inputs, which have no repetitions. One method of doing this first divides the input by a common denominator before using the (*) Lagrange interpolation formula; that method is named for Kronecker. This procedure is predicated on the fundamental theorem of algebra, which states that expressions of degree n have n roots. For 10 points, name this procedure that takes an expression consisting of variables and coefficients and rewrites it as a product.

TOSSUP: They’re not prime ideals, but according to the “going up” and “going down” theorems, integral examples of entities have the lying-over and the incomparability property. According to the primitive element theorem, finite separable ones are simple. Adjunction is the process of creating several “sub-“ examples of these entities. Those that are both normal and separable are called (*) Galois, and intermediate ones have a bijection with the subgroups of the Galois group according to the first fundamental theorem of Galois theory. A classic example of these entities involves taking the rational numbers and forming a group of numbers of the form a plus b times the square root of C; in this manner the complex numbers can be created from the real numbers. For 10 points, name these objects, which are constructions in which a field is expanded into a larger field.

TOSSUP: In a 1999 paper, Vaughan Jones described how to associate an algebra described by this adjective to a bipartite graph. Bar-Natan used algebras of this type to describe how tangle composition acts on Khovanov homology, and one example of an algebra with this property is the Temperley-Lieb algebra. Algorithms for testing whether other mathematical objects have this property often use a criterion named for Fraysseix and Rosenstiehl. Whitney proved that certain objects have this property only if their associated matroid is (*) cographic. Paul Koebe showed that graphs have this property if and only if they are coin graphs; Steinitz's theorem states that polyhedral graphs are exactly 3-connected graphs with this property. One method of proving that an object has this property is to prove it doesn’t have a subgraph isomorphic to K sub 5 or K sub 3-3. The best-known result about graphs with this property was popularized by De Morgan and proved by Appel and Haken with the aid of computers; that result is the four-color theorem. For 10 points, give this word which suggests that a graph can be drawn on a flat two-dimensional surface.

TOSSUP: Improving an argument of Robin Moser, Messner and Thierauf used a construct named for this mathematician to give a constructive proof of the Lovasz local lemma. A result named for him can be used to show that there is a critical density in bond percolation; that result is his zero-one law. An equation co-named for this non-English mathematician can be used to compute n-step transition probabilities in Markov chains; that equation is also named for (*) Chapman. This man is the first namesake of a theorem that deals with the preservation of quasiperiodic motion under small perturbations. His namesake complexity measure is used to prove Chaitin's incompleteness theorem and is sometimes called “descriptive complexity.” The standard axiomatization of probability theory is due to, for 10 points, what Russian mathematician who names a theorem with Arnold and Moser?

TOSSUP: A divide and conquer approach to calculating these starts by storing the extremes and then recurses on the four sub-planes defined by the lines connecting those extremes. An efficient output-sensitive algorithm to calculate these was dubbed the “ultimate planar” one and uses the “marriage-before-conquest” approach. A simple algorithm to calculate these iteratively chooses the point with the smallest angle from horizontal. Algorithms for constructing these include Kirkpatrick-Seidel algorithm and the Jarvis Match, also known as (*) “gift wrapping.” These constructs are useful for pattern recognition and collision detection, and they are usually visualized by imagining a rubber band stretching around the input points. For 10 points, name these constructions of a certain shape containing all of a given set of points.

TOSSUP: A functor named for this mathematician can be interpreted as the first group homology group with integral coefficients. A cellular automaton discovered by Bak, Tang, and Wiesenfeld that displays self-organized criticality is a “sandpile model” named for him. This mathematician names a class of theorems showing that various summation methods are regular, i.e., that they give the correct result for convergent series. Grothendieck introduced categories named for this mathematician in his Tohoku paper; those categories are a general setting for homological algebra and allow morphisms and objects to be added. This non-Italian mathematician gave the first complete proof of the insolubility of the quintic by radicals. Groups that satisfy the commutative law and many other mathematical concepts are named for, FTP, what Norwegian mathematician who died at the age of 26, thus making everyone else look like a chump?

TOSSUP: Numerical computations of this function often make use of the Lanczos approximation. Holder's theorem states that this function does not satisfy any algebraic differential equation with rational function coefficients. Its characterization as the unique meromorphic function which is log-convex and obeys certain functional equations is due to Bohr and Mollerup. It's not sine, but this function appears in the functional equation for the Riemann zeta function. For real arguments, it can be defined using the Euler integral of the second kind. This function has poles at all (*) nonpositive integers, but is analytic everywhere else. This function, which for some numbers is equal to the integral from 0 to infinity of x to the t minus 1 times e to the x dx. In the right half-plane, Stirling's formula provides a quick approximation to this function. For 10 points, name this function which extends the factorial function to the complex plane.

TOSSUP: One approach to doing this involves constructing a truncation of the tensor product of a one-dimensional multilevel basis. That approach was introduced by Smolyak and is known as “sparse grids.” One class of methods for this involves subdividing an interval when two approximations of the output differ greatly; those methods are known as adaptive algorithms. When a function under consideration is (*) well-approximated by a polynomial, methods named for Gauss may be used. When many variables are involved, naïve methods for doing this fall victim to the “curse of dimensionality.” Simple methods for this include Simpson's rule and the trapezoidal rule. For 10 points, name this operation, in the one dimensional case of which the area under a curve is estimated.

TOSSUP: An improvement on this result contains a denominator equal to the chi-square divergence of the probability density function of theta plus delta with respect to the pdf of theta; that improvement is named for Robbins, Chapman, and Hammersley. The single-parameter version of this result can be proven by taking the covariance of a test statistic with the score, using the chain rule, then applying the Cauchy-Schwartz inequality. This result can be used to prove that the maximum likelihood estimator is asymptotically (*) unbiased. Applying this result to a multivariate normal distribution gives a result of sigma-squared over N, and this statement can be used to find the unbiased estimator with the lowest mean-squared error. For 10 points, name this inequality that states that the variance of an unbiased estimator is at least as high as the inverse of the Fisher information, named for two statisticians.

TOSSUP: In a book about “using” this theorem, Jiri Matousek presents Alon's proof of the necklace theorem which makes use of it. Tucker's lemma is a combinatorial analog of this theorem, which Barany and Greene used to give tight lower bounds on the chromatic number of Kneser graphs. Corollaries of this theorem include the Lyusternik-Shnirel'man theorem, as well as the fact that any three solid figures in three-space can be simultaneously bisected, known as the ham sandwich theorem. This theorem implies the Brouwer fixed-point theorem, and it is often illustrated by claiming that there are two antipodal points on the Earth's surface with equal temperature and barometric pressure. For 10 points, what is this theorem, whose second namesake is better known for a chaos theory experiment with Fermi and Pasta and for helping Edward (*) Teller design thermonuclear weapons?

TOSSUP: In geometry, this equation can be used to give a local formula for the index of an elliptic complex; a paper of Atiyah, Bott, and Patodi took advantage of this fact to provide a new proof of the index theorem. Hamilton's Ricci flow, used in the proof of the Poincare conjecture, is sometimes known as “[this equation] for metrics.” One numerical method for solving this partial differential equation discretizes space and uses a (*) finite difference method to approximate partial derivatives; that is the Crank-Nicolson algorithm. Fourier series were introduced to solve the one-dimensional version of this equation, which is a prototypical parabolic PDE. Stating that the time partial derivative of the function under consideration is proportional to the Laplacian, for 10 points, name this equation which describes thermal diffusion.

TOSSUP: In algebraic geometry, a morphism between schemes is etale if it is both unramified and this. Heisuke Hironaka showed that, over a field of characteristic 0, every algebraic variety is birational to a projective variety with this property. Algebraic varieties are said to be this if they have no singular points. An integer is said to be this if it has no large prime factors. In analysis, mollifiers are used to create sequences of functions with this property. Frolicher spaces attempt to generalize the class of manifolds with this property. A complex-valued function with this property can generate another set of complex-valued functions with this property in a particular way according to Borel’s lemma. Every (*) analytic function has this property, but examples of functions with this property that are not analytic include the Fabius function and bump functions. For 10 points, what is this word describing a function which has derivatives of every order?

TOSSUP: Tipping and Bishop developed a probabilistic version of this technique, which works by marginalizing over a continuous latent space in which for each data point there is a corresponding latent variable. A canonical way of carrying out this technique is to compute the singular value decomposition of the data matrix, the columns of which yield the vectors sought by this technique. The application of this technique to time series is called the empirical orthogonal function method, and this technique involves the diagonalization of the covariance matrix to find the n eigenvectors corresponding to the n largest eigenvalues. For 10 points, identify this dimensionality reduction technique in which data is projected         onto a lower-dimensional linear space such that the variance of the projected data is maximized.

TOSSUP: Culberson and Luo developed the MAXIS algorithm to calculate this quantity, which works by dividing the target domain into maximally independent sets. An algorithm for calculating this quantity, unrelated to the traveling salesman problem, was developed by Nicos Christofides, while the Brelaz DSATUR heuristic is also used to calculate this quantity, though it does not guarantee minimality. A theorem which gives the upper bound of this quantity as either the maximum degree delta, or one plus delta, was proven by Brooks, while Konig's theorem sets this quantity equal to or less than two if the corresponding structure has no odd cycles. According to a theorem proved by Appel and Haken, this quantity is equal to four for a plane separated into contiguous regions. For 10 points, identify this quantity which represents the smallest number of distinct colors needed to color a graph so that no two vertices have the same color.

TOSSUP: The set of derivations on these mathematical objects is a semisimple Lie algebra of dimension 14; Ã‰lie Cartan showed that their automorphism group is the smallest of the exceptional Lie groups. The nonzero members of this alternative algebra form a nonassociative Moufang loop under their namesake multiplication. This number system is the largest normed division algebra; the Fano plane can be used to multiply the units in it.  The projective plane over this number system is named for(*) Cayley; one method of constructing them is named for Cayley and Dickson. In this non-associative number system, multiplying any non-identity element of this number system by itself gives the negative of the identity element. The discoverer of this number system was inspired by William Hamilton and used it to express the product of two sums of eight squares as another sum of eight squares. For 10 points, name this system invented by John Graves, an extension of the quaternions.

TOSSUP: One paper that attempted to solve this problem first introduced the creation of a sequence of numbers beginning 15, 4697, and 5548, which the paper's author called genitores, and eventually led to Kochanski's approximation. Martin Gardner's construction was accurate to six decimal places; Srinivasa Ramanujan's to eight. One result important to this problem involved showing that if a complex number z is the root of an integral polynomial(*), then e to the z plus one cannot equal zero. That result is known as the Lindemann-Weierstrass theorem. Earlier attempts to solve it included the Lune of Hippocrates and Antiphon's side-doubling arguments. For 10 points, name this problem, which along with doubling the cube and trisecting the angle perplexed ancient Greek mathematicians, whose goal was to create a geometrically regular four-sided polygon of the same area as a given circle within a finite number of steps.

TOSSUP: Laurie Kirby and Jeff Paris showed that it is not possible to prove that every Goodstein sequence terminates at zero in this system; Paris and Leo Harrington used model theory and the condition that the cardinality of x is greater than or equal to its minimum to show that a strengthened finite Ramsey theorem is true in this system, but is similarly unprovable. Unlike a weaker version invented by Pressburger that omits(*) multiplication, this system is not decidable.  A proof that defined a quantity epsilon sub zero using transfinite induction was used to attempt to answer Hilbert's second problem; that proof by Gerhard Gentzen demonstrated this system's consistency.  One statement in this system defines a "successor" function that is used in definitions of induction, others give the properties of the equality relation, and the first of these define zero as part of the set.  For 10 points, name this set of axioms defining the natural numbers, invented by an Italian.

TOSSUP: A foliation of this object is named for Reeb, while a fibration describing this object is known as the Hopf bundle. This object is homeomorphic to the one-point compactification of the 3-dimensional Euclidean space. The set of all versors, or unit quaternions, forms this type of manifold. As a Lie group, this object is equivalent to the symplectic group Sp(1) and diffeomorphic to SU(2), which implies that it is parallelizable. A 2002 e-print on the arXiv ("archive") titled "The entropy formula for the (*) Ricci flow and its geometric applications" was the first of a series of three posts resolving a major question about these objects. Any simply connected closed 3-manifold is homeomorphic to this object, as was proven by Grigori Perelman in the PoincarÃ© conjecture. For 10 points, name this object which can be thought of as the boundary of a 4-dimensional ball, a higher-dimensional analogue of a sphere.

TOSSUP: In one attempted proof of this theorem, William Osgood took issue with the implications when the boundary is not a simply closed Jordan curve; in that attempt, Axel Harnack used what is now Harnack's theorem and established the existence of a Green's function. One method of proving this theorem involves taking the normal family of analytic functions that send a fixed z-naught to zero and finding a member function with the supremum value for f prime of z-naught; modern methods of proving it often involve using a form of the Schwarz lemma.  The namesake of this theorem coined the name for (and arguably relied on) the result from potential theory now called Dirichlet's principle(*), which can be used to complete the existence proof for this theorem. The uniformization theorem can be seen as the same result for surfaces as this theorem gives for plane regions. For 10 points, name this theorem first described in its formulator's 1851 PhD thesis, which shows the existence of a bijective holomorphic function which takes a non-empty simply connected open subset of the complex numbers onto the open unit disk.

TOSSUP: One famous result named for him states that if G is the cyclic Galois group of a finite extension K over F with generator beta, and u is an element in K with a relative norm of 1, then there exists v such that u is equal to beta of v, divided by v.  That theorem, actually discovered by Ernst Kummer, was the 90th in a volume that he was to co-author with Minkowski, though Minkowski ended up not contributing.  One way to prove another of his theorems hinges on proving Zariski's lemma; that theorem uses two bijective maps which are inverses of each other to show a correspondence between affine varieties(*) and radical ideals in a polynomial ring and is a foundational result of algebraic geometry.  Another of his theorems states that if R is a Noetherian ring, then the polynomial ring over R is also Noetherian.  These results are respectively his Theorem 90, his Nullstellensatz, and his basis theorem.  For 10 points, name this former University of GÃ¶ttingen professor who at the 1900 International Congress of Mathematicians presented a list of 23 important unsolved problems.

TOSSUP: A paper subtitled "Wild 3-adic exercises" by Christophe Breuil, Brian Conrad, Fred Diamond, and Richard Taylor proved a landmark theorem involving a feature of these objects. The problem of determining whether a square-free positive integer is a congruent number is equivalent to determining whether one of these mathematical objects has a positive rank. If one of these objects is defined over the rationals, it is necessarily a finitely generated Abelian group according to Mordell's theorem. They can be used to perform prime factorization in the Lenstra method, and to test whether a number is prime using the Atkin-Morain algorithm. (*) Provided a "point at infinity" is added, any straight line drawn through two points on one of these objects must pass through a third point on it. The modularity theorem that relates these objects over the field of rationals to modular forms used to be known as the Taniyama-Shimura conjecture. These objects are described by the equation y squared equals x cubed plus A x plus B. For 10 points, name these curves that were famously used by Andrew Wiles to prove Fermat's Last Theorem.

TOSSUP: A functor F from categories C to D has this property if it commutes with limits; similarly, functors of this type preserve all small limits.  The morphisms of the category Top are maps which all have this property. In descriptive set theory, this property is studied as the intersection between all the G-delta sets, which quantify oscillation as less than epsilon. According to one definition, this property is possessed by the Cantor function, and Peano curves have that property when the exponent is one-half. The Heine-Cantor theorem concerns this property between metric spaces M and N; when M is compact, (*) every function possessing this property must possess the uniform type of it. One set of functions can comply with the HÃ¶lder definition of this property but not the Lipschitz definition. That set of nowhere differentiable functions, along with an epsilon-delta definition of this property, is named for Weierstrass. For 10 points, name this property of a function, defined by Cauchy in terms of two related infinitesimal changes, which is usually contingent on a function's graph having no "holes" or "jumps."

TOSSUP: This operation is an automorphism of the Schwartz space and, by duality, the space of tempereddistributions. This operation restricted to the dense subspace formed by the intersection of the L1 and L2spaces is a linear isometry into L2 according to the Plancherel theorem, which can be used to prove itsuniqueness. The integral over the reals of the squared modulus of a function f is equal to the integral overthe reals of the squared modulus of this operation applied to f, which is equivalent to the fact that thisoperation is unitary, according to Parseval's relation.

A generalization of these structuresis defined over a ring and is a module. A subset of these structures is the subject of the Steinitz exchangelemma. Over a field F, they can be defined as an abelian group, A, and a ring homomorphism from F to theendomorphism ring of A, which maps the identity to the identity. One property of these structures can befound by adding the dimension of the image and kernel of a linear transformation according to therank-nullity theorem. These structures are closed under addition and scalar multiplication. For 10 points,identify these spaces studied in linear algebra.

TOSSUP:  In number theory, one form of this quantity is sensitive to the first terms of a sequence, being zero ifone is not in the set and less than one-half if two is not in the set. That form of this quantity is contrastedwith another form equal to the limit as n goes to infinity of the number of integers less than n in a set, overn; that form is zero for a finite sequence. Those two forms are the Schnirelmann and asymptotic types.According to the Baire category theorem, the intersection of countably many open sets with this property isnonempty, and a complete metric space is not the union of countably many closed sets that nowhere havethis property. A subset S of a metric space X has this property if and only if there is some point of S in eachnonempty open set of X.

Two sufficient conditions for this property are having odd order or having order equal to the product of two powers of primes according to the Feit-Thompson theorem and Burnside's theorem. A group has this property if a series of normal subgroups can be constructed such that each is the quotient of the previous group by an Abelian factor group.

The hieroglpyh "heh", consisting of a seated man with both of his arms raised, represented one of these words. In the Greek alphabet, an obsolete letter called Sampi was used to represent one of these words, while in Hebrew script these words are among those that are marked with Gershayim. The Piraha lanuage, spoken in Amazonia, appears to lack words of this kind, and is therefore being used to test the Sapir-Whorf hypothesis by seeing if Piraha speakers can perform arithmetic. FTP, give these words that can be ordinal or cardinal, and in English include words like "fifteen" and "negative five".

TOSSUP: In this field, the Palais-Smale compactness condition and the mountain pass theorem are used to establish the existence of critical points. The duBois-Reymond Lemma is a generalization of the Fundamental Lemma of this area of study. This field is itself generalized "in the large" by the branch of differential topology known as Morse theory.  The Beltrami identity is often used to simplify the differential equation central to this field, the Euler-Lagrange equation, the solutions to which are functions for which a given functional is minimized or maximized. The most famous problem in this area was posed by Johann Bernoulli, and the solution to that problem is a cycloid. FTP, name this branch of mathematics whose development was spurred by the brachistochrone problem.

TOSSUP: A space has this property if and only if every continuous map from a closed subset to the reals with the Euclidean topology can be extended to a continuous map from the space. That characterization of this type of space by the Tietze extension theorem is related to the fact that this type of space is one in which disjoint closed subsets can be separated by functions, as prescribed in Urysohn's lemma. A space with this property and the Hausdorff property is said to satisfy the T-four axiom, and this type of space is usually defined as one in which disjoint closed subsets have disjoint neighborhoods, as opposed to a regular space.

In computer graphics, the Catmull-Rom variety of this method is used to smooth the panning and scanning between camera keyframes and the curves in postscript and truetype fonts are constructed from cubic and quadratic bezier forms of these functions respectively. FTP, name these piecewise defined continuous functions used to interpolate a curve along a set of knots or points.

TOSSUP: The Whitehead link is a counterexample to an attempted proof of this theorem. A more general form of this theorem which describes a classification system based on decompositions was formulated by William Thurston. John Milnor showed that this theorem was valid in seven (*) dimensions, leading to work by Steven Smale which showed the validity of this theorem in dimensions five and higher, after which Michael Freedman pushed the upper dimension bound on this theorem down to four. The eventual proof of this theorem was made possible by Richard Hamilton's work on Ricci flows.

For ultrametrics, thisquantity is always of a Robinsonian type. One variant of this measure is a scale-invariant quantity calculated using acorrelation matrix and is used to compare two distributions, and is named for P.C. Mahalanobis. For a metric space, thistype of measure is required to be non-negative, symmetric, and must satisfy the (*) triangle inequality. This type of quantityis the length of the shortest path connecting two vertices in graph theory. For 2D Euclidean spaces, it is the square root of the sumof the squares of the differences of the x and y coordinates. For 10 points, identify this type of measure that, in Euclidean space, isdefined as the length of a line connecting two points.

TOSSUP: A set of these points that are characterized by the birth of closed invariant curves and can lead to the formation of a torusin limit-cycle maps is named for Neimark and Sacker. For systems generated by a set of autonomous ordinary differentialequations, one of these points occurs when critical equilibrium has exactly one zero eigenvalue. If several branches havean equilibrium point at which the Jacobian is zero, the equilibrium point is classified as one of these points. These pointsare defined to be "supercritical" if they lead to the development of (*) stabilizing cycles.

Thisdistribution, for k components with parameters alpha, is a probability distribution over a k-minus-1 dimensional simplexwith the density equal to the inverse of the beta function times the iterated product of the i-th component raised to thealpha minus one. It is the conjugate prior of the multinomial distribution, and the (*) beta distribution is itself a special caseof this distribution for two dimensions.

The Dedekind zeta function is given as the sum of the inverses of the norm of these structures on a given number field and these structures can be constructed by a generative subset called a Grobner basis. A subset can be said to be one of these entities if for any(*) two elements in the subset, the difference of those elements also exists. The kernel of a ring homeomorphism is one of these structures and if a multiplicative identity exists, then Krull's theorem states a maximal one must also exist.

One statement proven by this man was later generalized using Hausdorff spaces by Marshall Stone and that original proof showed any continuous function can be written as a polynomial. This man also names a test that states a sequence converges uniformly if it is less than or equal to a set of constants(*) M and the sum over all M is finite. He described a function defined as the infinite linear combination of cosines with argument "b to the n times pi times x" and that function has the special property of continuous but nowhere differentiable.

TOSSUP: A multiplicative variety of this process is related to theÂ integration of the gamma function multiplied by an inverse-power law over bounds of complex infinities and is known as the Cahen-Mellin version. This process will converge for a locally integrable function if there exists a limit as the upper bound of that integral approaches infinity. In probability theory, this operation is given as the expectation value of the negative(*) exponential of a random variable.

TOSSUP: One namesake of this result is also the namesake of an order formula for objects containing only two conjugacy classes, and that namesake also names a series with McKay used to prove the "moonshine conjecture" of Conway and Norton. Bender's method was used to streamline the proof of this result. This result was first proven based on work done by Michio Suzuki, and was restricted to objects for which the centralizer of every non-trivial element is nilpotent. The proof of this result showed that each non-trivial irreducible character arises only once as an exceptional character, and used the method of local analysis; that proof was over 200 pages long. This theorem was originally developed based on a conjecture by Burnside, which asked whether finite simple groups of odd order exist.

Their order is given by the number of unique indices in a term, while repeated indices within a term are summed by the conventions of Einstein notation. Those of the second order always possess a determinant because they must be square, while zeroth order ones are scalars and first order ones are vectors. For 10 points, name these generalizations of scalar and vector quantities to higher dimensions that are studied in a namesake calculus.

TOSSUP: Sylvester's Law of Inertia implies that a bilinear form of this type has unique index and signature.

Its namesake property for ideals is equivalent to a P-point of the Cech-Stone compactification beta-omega, but it fails for ideals when their quotient Boolean algebra has a countably splitting family. Its extension to transfinite step sequences with ordinal indices leads to a proof for the Erdos-Rado theorem. (*) One of its common proofs generates a series of nested intervals, each of which contains the leftmost subinterval of the last, and demonstrates that their left end points are a Cauchy sequence with a limit about which the subinterval contains infinitely many points of an infinite set.

W.W. Rouse Ball first extended its premise to diagram-tracing puzzles. Variations of this problem attempt to add further arcs to identified nodes marked by the Blue Prince, the Red Prince, the Gasthaus, and the Kirche, though uneven degrees of the original nodes prevent its positive solution.

TOSSUP: If a Hausdorff group is Abelian or compact, then it is said to have the Haar type of this property, which is a special case of the Borel type. Boolean sigma-algebras are described by this adjective if a function mu applied to an indexing set is equal to the summation of the function values of that set, and spaces with the sigma-finite variety of this can be assigned a unique integral function using the Radon-Nikodym theorem. The theorem of Caratheodory outlines properties of the outer type of this concept, and values of the best-known type of this concept include 0 for the Cantor set and 1 for a unit line segment. The Jordan form of this concept is used to define the Riemann integral. For 10 points, name this concept from analysis whose best-known variety is the Lebesgue. 

TOSSUP: Martin's axiom implies that there are sequential spaces of sequential order four with this property.  Sets with this property include those named after Eberlein, Valdivia, and Corson.  Stone and Cech name a technique for mapping a topological space to a Hausdorff space with this property. The Cartesian product of any number of sets with this property also has this property by Tychonoff's Theorem, which is sometimes used to prove a theorem stating that a subspace of Euclidean space has this property if and only if it is closed and bounded, the Heine-Borel theorem.  For 10 points, give this term referring to spaces or sets in which every open cover has a finite subcover.

TOSSUP: Zuehlke showed that Wiles' proof of Fermat's last theorem can be extended to Gaussian integers using this statement, and comically noted that the proof "almost fits in the margin." Its namesake and Kuzmin used Siegel's lemma to extend it to the real quadratic field, and it was generalized by Alan Baker, who proved the linear independence of an arbitrary number of logarithms. Proving Schanuel's conjecture would imply both the Lindemann-Weierstrass theorem and this theorem. Its namesake also lends his name to a constant sometimes called Hilbert's constant, which is equal to 2 raised to the square root of 2. The first approach to a solution for Hilbert's 7th problem, for 10 points, identify this theorem which states that if a is algebraic and b is both algebraic and irrational, then a raised to the bth power is transcendental, which is sometimes also named for its independent discoverer Theodor Schneider.

TOSSUP: Methods used to compute it include various embarassingly parallel implementations, the Hubbard-Douady potential, and the Milnor algorithm. It is self-similar, as well as being connected and compact. One definition of this construction is as the connectedness locus of a family of complex polynomials, f sub c of z. The more common definition shows it as the set of all complex points c such that the sequence zero, f sub c of zero, f sub c of f sub c of zero, et cetera stays within a ring of finite radius around the origin, where f sub c of z is the polynomial z squared ►plus c. FTP, identify this set, best known as a fractal cardioid with bulbs and "seahorse"-like shapes.

TOSSUP: In the reproducing kernel type of these, pointwise evaluation is a continuous linear operator. Also known as a unitary space, Cn [c n; NOT c to the n] is one with the inner product of x and y as the sum of the product of the components of x and the components of the complex conjugate of y. Defined as a Banach space where the inner product used is the norm, they extend the vector methods of Euclidean space to infinite-dimensional space. FTP, name this ►class of spaces, commonly used in quantum mechanics, named for a German mathematician.

TOSSUP: This man showed that if the position wave function is localized then the momentum wave function is infinitely unlocalized in a theorem named for him and Paley. His books include one once dubbed "The Yellow Peril" for its cover but actually entitled "Extrapolation, Interpolation and Smoothing of Stationary Time Series" and one more humorously entitled God and Golem, Inc. He postulated that the power spectrum of a signal is the Fourier transformation of its autocorrelation function in a theorem with Khintchine. He's the namesake of a tauberian theorem as well as ►a filter which reduces noise present in a signal and a process exemplified by Brownian motion, but he's even better known as the founder of cybernetics. FTP, name this mathematician who may have also had a really big head.  

TOSSUP: In an influential 1970 paper, Gerard Debreu used this theorem to show that economic equilibria are not generally unique but locally unique, and it was applied to game theory by Kreps and Wilson in 1982. Steven Smale generalized it to the infinite-dimensional case by introducing mappings of Banach manifolds. It holds that a smooth surjection between Euclidean spaces must be a submersion and posits that images of the set of critical points have Lebesgue measure zero. FTP, name this theorem ►from differential topology sometimes also named for Morse.
